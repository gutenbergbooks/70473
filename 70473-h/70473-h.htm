The first, a small half-sheet, inclosed in a large
thick envelope, and addressed in a childish,
unformed hand to Mr. James Everard Forrest,
Junior, Ellicottville, Berkshire County, Massachusetts,
with a request in the lower left-hand
corner for the postmaster to forward immediately;
the second, a dainty little perfumed missive, with a
fanciful monogram, directed in a plain round hand to J.
Everard Forrest, Esq., Ellicottville, Mass., with the words
“in haste” written in the corner. Both letters were in a
hurry, and both found their way together to a brown-haired,
brown-eyed, brown-faced young man, who sat
under the shadow of the big maple tree on the Common
in Ellicottville, lazily puffing his cigar and fanning himself
with his Panama hat, for the thermometer was
ninety in the shade, and the hour 10 <span class='fss'>A. M.</span> of a sultry
July day. At first it was almost too much exertion to
break the seals, and for a moment J. Everard Forrest,
Jr., toyed with the smaller envelope of the two, and
studied the handwriting.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I may as well see what Josey wants of me <em>in
haste</em>,” he said at last, and breaking the seal, he read:</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c012'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Holburton</span>, July 15.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Ned</span>: You must come to-morrow on the four
o’clock train. Everything has gone at sixes and sevens,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>for just at the very last Mrs. Murdock, who has been
dying for twenty years or more, must really die, and the
Murdock boys can’t act, so you must take the character
of the bridegroom in the play where I am to be the
bride. You will have very little to say. You can learn
it all in fifteen minutes, but you must come to-morrow so
as to rehearse with us once at least. Now, don’t you
<em>dare</em> fail. I shall meet you at the station.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Yours lovingly,</div>
      <div class='line in8'>“<span class='sc'>Josephine Fleming</span>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“P. S.—Do you remember I wrote you in my last of
a Dr. Matthewson, who has been in town a few days
stopping at the hotel? He has consented to be the priest
on condition that <em>you</em> are the bridegroom, so do not fail
me.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Again, with love,      <span class='sc'>Joe</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“And so this is my lady’s great haste,” the young
man said, as he finished reading the letter. “She wants
me for her bridegroom, and I don’t know but I’m willing,
so I guess I’ll have to go; and now for Rossie’s interesting
document, which must be ‘forwarded immediately.’
I only wish it may prove to have money in it from
the governor, for I am getting rather low.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So saying he took the other letter and examined it
carefully, while a smile broke over his face as he continued:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Upon my word, Rossie did not mean this to go
astray, and has written everything out in full, even to
Massachusetts and Junior. Good for her. But how
crooked; why, that junior stands at an angle of several
degrees above the Mr. Rossie ought to do better. She
must be nearly thirteen; but she’s a nice little girl, and
I’ll see what she says.”</p>

<p class='c011'>What she said was as follows:</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Forrest House</span>, July 14th.</div>

      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Everard Forrest</span>:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“<em>Dear Sir</em>:—Nobody knows I am writing to you, but
your mother has been worse for a few days, and keeps
talking about you even in her sleep. She did not say
send for you, but I thought if you knew how bad she
was, you would perhaps come home for a part of your
vacation. It will do her so much good to see you. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>am very well and your father too. So no more at
present.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“P. S.—Miss Beatrice Belknap has come home from
New York, and had the typhoid fever, and lost every
speck of her beautiful hair. You don’t know how
funny she looks! She offered me fifty dollars for mine
to make her a wig, because it curls naturally, and is just
her color, but I would not sell it for the world: would
you? Inclosed find ten dollars of my very own money,
which I send you to come home with, thinking you
might need it. Do not fail to come, will you?</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Rosamond.</span>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Everard read this letter twice, and smoothed out the
crisp ten-dollar bill, which was carefully wrapped in a
separate bit of paper. It was not the first time he had
received money in his sore need from the girl, for in a
blank-book, which he always carried in his pocket, were
several entries, as follows: “Jan. 2, from Rosamond
Hastings, five dollars: March 4th, two dollars: June
8th, one dollar,” and so on until the whole amount was
more than twenty dollars, but never before had she sent
him so large a sum as now, and there was a moisture in
his eyes and his breath came heavily as he put it away
in his purse, and said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“There never was so unselfish a creature as Rossie
Hastings. She is always thinking of somebody else.
And I am a mean, contemptible dog to take her money
as I do; but then, I honestly intend to pay her back
tenfold when I have something of my own.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus reassuring himself, he put his purse in his pocket,
and glancing again at Rossie’s letter his eye fell upon
Miss Belknap’s name, and he laughed aloud as he said:
“Poor bald Bee Belknap. She must look comical.
I can imagine how it hurts her pride. Buy Rossie’s hair,
indeed! I should think not, when that is her only beauty,
if I except her eyes, which are too large for her thin
face; but that will round out in time, and Rossie may be
a beauty yet, though not like Josey; no, never like Josey.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And that brought the young man back to Miss
Fleming’s letter, and its imperative request. Could he
comply with it now? Ought he not to go at once to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>sick mother, who was missing him so sadly, and who had
made all the happiness he had ever known at home?
Duty said yes, but inclination drew him to Holburton
and the fair Josephine, with whom he believed himself
to be and with whom he was, perhaps, as much in love
as any young man of twenty well can be. Perhaps Rossie
had been unduly alarmed; at all events, if his mother
were so very sick, his father would write, of course, and
on the whole he believed he should go to Holburton by
the afternoon train, and then, perhaps, go home.</p>

<p class='c011'>And so the die was cast, and the young man walked to
the telegraph office and sent across the wires to Miss
Josephine Fleming the three words: “I will come.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER II.<br> <span class='large'>DR. MATTHEWSON.</span></h2>
</div>

<div class='c010'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/di_010.jpg' width='100' alt=''>
</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
The train from Ellicottville was late that afternoon.
In fact, its habit was to be late, but on
this particular day it was more than usually
behind time, and the one stage which Holburton
boasted had waited more than half an
hour at the little station of the out-of-the-way town which
lies nestled among the Berkshire hills, just on the boundary
line between the Empire State and Massachusetts.
The day was hot even for midsummer, and the two fat,
motherly matrons who sat in the depot alternately inveighed
against the heat and wiped their glowing faces,
while they watched and discussed the young lady who,
on the platform outside, was walking up and down, seeming
wholly unconscious of their espionage. But it was
only seeming, for she knew perfectly well that she was
an object of curiosity and criticism, and more than once
she paused in her walk and turning squarely round faced
the two old ladies in order to give them a better view,
and let them see just how many tucks, and ruffles and
puffs there were in her new dress, worn that day for the
first time. And a very pretty picture Josephine Fleming
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>made standing there in the sunshine, looking so artless
and innocent, as if no thought of herself had ever entered
her mind. She was a pink-and-white blonde, with masses
of golden hair rippling back from her forehead, and those
dreamy blue eyes of which poets sing, and which have in
them a marvelous power to sway the sterner sex by that
pleading, confiding expression, which makes a man very
tender towards the helpless creature appealing so innocently
to him for protection.</p>

<p class='c011'>The two old ladies did not like Josephine, though
they admitted that she was very beautiful and stylish, in
her blue muslin and white chip hat with the long feather
drooping low behind, too pretty by far and too much of
the fine lady, they said, for a daughter of the widow
Roxie Fleming, who lived in the brown house on the
Common, and sewed for a living when she had no
boarders from the city. And then, as the best of women
will sometimes do, they picked the girl to pieces, and
talked of the scandalous way she had of flirting with
every man in town, of her airs and indolence, which they
called laziness, and wondered if it were true that poor
old Agnes, her half-sister, made the young lady’s bed,
and mended her clothes, and waited upon her generally
as if she were a princess, and toiled, and worked, and
went without herself, that Josey might be clothed in
dainty apparel, unbecoming to one in her rank of life.
And then they wondered next if it were true, as had
been rumored, that she was engaged to that young Forrest
from Amherst College, who had boarded at the
brown house for a few weeks the previous summer, and
been there so often since.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A well-mannered chap as you would wish to see,”
one of them said, “with a civil word for high and low,
and a face of which any mother might be proud;
only——” and here the speaker lowered her voice, as
she continued: “Only he does look a little fast, for no
decent-behaved boy of twenty ought to have such a
tired, fagged look as he has, and they do say there were
some great carousin’s at Widder Fleming’s last summer,
which lasted up to midnight, and wine was carried in by
Agnes, and hot coffee made as late as eleven, and if
you’ll b’leve it”—here the voice was a whisper—“they
had a <em>pack of cards</em>, for Miss Murdock saw them with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>her own eyes, and young Forrest handled them as if
used to the business.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Cards! That settles it!” was repeated by the second
woman, with a shake of the head, which indicated
that she knew all she cared to know of Everard Forrest,
but her friend, who was evidently better posted in the
gossip of the town, went on to add that “people said
young Forrest was an only son, and that his father was
very rich, and lived in a fine old place somewhere west
or south, and had owned negroes in Kentucky before the
war, and was a copperhead, and very close and proud,
and kept colored help, and would not like it at all if he
knew how his son was flirting with Josephine Fleming.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then they talked of the expected entertainment at
the Village Hall the following night, the proceeds of
which were to go toward buying a fire-engine, which the
people greatly needed. And Josephine was to figure in
most everything, and they presumed she was now waiting
for some chap to come on the train.</p>

<p class='c011'>For once they were right in their conjecture. She
was waiting for Everard Forrest, and when the train
came in he stepped upon the platform looking so fresh,
and cool, and handsome in his white linen suit that the
ladies almost forgave Josephine for the gushing manner
with which she greeted him, and carried him off toward
home. She was so glad to see him, and her eyes looked
at him so softly and tenderly, and she had so much to
tell him, and was so excited with it all, and the brown
house overgrown with hop-vines was so cool and pleasant,
and Agnes had such a tempting little supper prepared
for him on the back piazza, that Everard felt supremely
happy and content, and once, when nobody was looking
on, kissed the blue-eyed fairy flitting so joyously around
him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I say, Josey,” he said, when the tea-things had been
removed, and he was lounging in his usual lazy attitude
upon the door-step and smoking his cigar, “it’s a heap
nicer here than down in that hot, close hall. Let’s not
go to the rehearsal. I’d rather stay home.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But you can’t do it. You must go,” Josephine replied.
“You must rehearse and learn your part, though
for to-night it doesn’t matter. You can go through the
marriage ceremony well enough, can’t you?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>“Of course I can, and can say, ‘I, Everard, take thee,
Josie, to be my lawful wife,’ and, by Jove, I wouldn’t
care if it was genuine. Suppose we get a priest, and
make a real thing of it. I’m willing, if you are.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a pretty blush on Josey’s cheek as she replied,
“What nonsense you are talking, and you not yet
through college!” and then hurried him off to the
hall, where the rehearsal was to take place.</p>

<p class='c011'>Here an unforeseen difficulty presented itself. Dr.
Matthewson was not forthcoming in his character as
priest. He had gone out of town, and had not yet returned;
so another took his place in the marriage scene,
where Everard was the bridegroom and Josephine the
bride. The play was called “The Mock Marriage,” and
would be very effective with the full glamour of lights,
and dress, and people on the ensuing night; and Josephine
declared herself satisfied with the rehearsal, and
sanguine of success, especially as Dr. Matthewson
appeared at the last moment apologizing for his tardiness,
and assuring her of his intention to be present the
next evening.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was a tall, powerfully-built man of thirty or more,
whom many would call handsome, though there was a
cruel, crafty look in his eyes, and in the smile which
habitually played about his mouth. Still, he was very
gentlemanly in his manner, and fascinating in his conversation,
for he had traveled much, and seen everything,
and spoke both German and French as readily as
his mother tongue. With Miss Fleming he seemed to be
on the most intimate terms, though this intimacy only
dated from the time when she pleaded with him so
prettily and successfully to take the place of the priest
in “The Mock Marriage,” where John Murdock was
to have officiated. At first the doctor had objected, saying
gallantly that he preferred to be the bridegroom, and
asking who that favored individual was to be.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mr. Everard Forrest, from Rothsay, Southern
Ohio,” Josephine replied, with a conscious blush which
told much to the experienced man of the world.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Forrest! Everard Forrest!” the doctor repeated
thoughtfully, and the smile about his mouth was more
perceptible. “Seems to me I have heard that name before.
Where did you say he lived, and where is he now?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>Josephine replied again that Mr. Forrest’s home was
in Rothsay, Ohio, at a grand old place called Forrest
House; that he was a student at Amherst, and was
spending his summer vacation with a friend in Ellicottville.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I understand,” the doctor rejoined, adding, after
a moment’s pause: “I’ll be the priest; but suppose I had
the power to marry you in earnest; what then?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, you wouldn’t. You must not. Everard is not
through college, and it would be so very dreadful—and
romantic, too,” the girl said, as she looked searchingly
into the dark eyes meeting hers so steadily.</p>

<p class='c011'>Up to that time Dr. Matthewson had taken but little
notice of Josephine, except to remark her exceeding
beauty as a golden-haired blonde. With his knowledge
of the world and ready discernment he had discovered
that whatever position she held in Holburton was due to
her beauty and piquancy, and firm resolve to be noticed,
rather than to any blood, or money, or culture. She was
not a lady, he knew, the first time he saw her in the little
church, and, attracted by her face, watched her through
the service, while she whispered, and laughed, and passed
notes to the young men in front of her. Without any
respect himself for religion or the church, he despised
irreverence in others, and formed a tolerably accurate
estimate of Josephine and her companions. After her
interview with him, however, he became greatly interested
in everything pertaining to her, and by a little adroit
questioning learned all there was to be known of her,
and, as is usual in such cases, more too. Her mother was
poor, and crafty and designing, and very ambitious for
her daughter’s future. That she took in sewing and
kept boarders was nothing to her detriment in a
village, where the people believed in honest labor,
but that she traded on her daughter’s charms, and
brought her up in utter idleness, while Agnes, the child
of her husband’s first marriage, was made a very drudge
and slave to the young beauty, was urged against her as
a serious wrong, and, except as the keeper of a boarding-house,
in which capacity she excelled, the Widow
Fleming was not very highly esteemed in Holburton.
All this Dr. Matthewson learned, and then he was told
of young Forrest, a mere boy, two years younger
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>than Josey, who had stopped with Mrs. Fleming a few
weeks the previous summer, and for whom both Josey
and the mother had, to use the landlady’s words, “made
a dead set,” and succeeded, too, it would seem, for if they
were not engaged they ought to be, though it was too
bad for the boy, and somebody ought to tell his father.</p>

<p class='c011'>Such was in substance the story told by the hostess
of the Eagle to Dr. Matthewson, who smiled serenely as
he heard it, and stroked his silken mustache thoughtfully,
and then went down to call upon Miss Fleming,
and judge for himself how well she was fitted to be the
mistress of Forrest House.</p>

<p class='c011'>When Everard came and was introduced to him after
the rehearsal, there was a singular expression in the eyes
which scanned the young man so curiously; but the
doctor’s manners were perfect, and never had Everard
been treated with more deference and respect than by
this handsome stranger, who called upon him at Mrs.
Fleming’s early in the morning, and in the course of an
hour established himself on such terms of intimacy with
the young man that he learned more of his family history
than Josephine herself knew after an acquaintance of
more than a year. Everard never could explain to himself
how he was led on naturally and easily to speak of
his home in Rothsay, the grand old place of which he
would be heir, as he was the only child. He did not
know how much his father was worth, he said, as his
fortune was estimated at various sums, but it didn’t do
him much good, for the governor was close, and insisted
upon knowing how every penny was spent. Consequently
Everard, who was fast and expensive in his habits, was,
as he expressed it, always hard up, and if his mother
did not occasionally send him something unknown to his
father he would be in desperate straits, for a fellow in
college with the reputation of being rich must have
money.</p>

<p class='c011'>Here Everard thought of Rosamond and what she
had sent him, but he could not speak of that to this
stranger, who sat smiling so sweetly upon him, and leading
him on step by step until at last Rossie’s name <em>did</em>
drop from his lips, and was quickly caught up by Dr.
Matthewson.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>“Rossie!” he repeated, in his low, purring tone,
“Rossie! Who is she? Have you a sister?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, no. I told you I was an only child. Rossie is
Rosamond Hastings, a little girl whose mother was my
mother’s most intimate friend. They were school-girls
together, and pledged themselves to stand by each other
should either ever come to grief, as Mrs. Hastings did.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Married unhappily, perhaps?” the doctor suggested,
and Everard replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes; married a man much older than herself, who
abused her so shamefully that she left him at last, and
sought refuge with my mother. Fortunately this Hastings
died soon after, so she was freed from him; but she
had another terror in the shape of his son, the child of a
former marriage, who annoyed her dreadfully.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How could he?” the doctor asked, and Everard
replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I hardly know. I believe, though, it was about
some house or piece of land, of which Mrs. Hastings
held the deed for Rossie, and this John thought he
ought to share it, at least, and seemed to think it a fortune,
when in fact it proved to be worth only two
thousand dollars, which is all Rosamond has of her
own.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Perhaps he did not know how little there was, and
thought it unjust for his half-sister to have all his father
left, and he nothing,” the doctor said, and it never once
occurred to Everard to wonder how he knew that Mr.
Hastings left <em>all</em> to his daughter, and nothing to his son.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was wholly unsuspicious, and went on:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Possibly; at all events he worried his stepmother
into hysterics by coming there one day in winter, and
demanding first the deed or will, and second his sister,
whom he said his father gave to his charge. But I
settled him!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes?” the doctor said, interrogatively, and Everard
continued:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Father was gone, and this wretch, who must have
been in liquor, was bullying my mother, and declaring
he would go to the room where Mrs. Hastings was fainting
for fear of him, when I came in from riding, and
just bade him begone; and when he said to me sneeringly,
‘Oh, little David, what do you think you can do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>with the giant, you have no sling?’ I hit him a cut
with my riding-whip which made him wince with pain,
and I followed up the blows till he left the house vowing
vengeance on me for the insult offered him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And since then?” the doctor asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Since then I have never seen him. After Mrs.
Hastings died he wrote an impertinent letter to father
asking the guardianship of his sister, but we had promised
her mother solemnly never to let her fall into his
hands or under his influence, and father wrote him such
a letter as settled him; at least, we have never heard
from him since, and that is eight years ago. Nor should
I know him either, for it was dark, and he all muffled
up.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And have you no fear of him, that he may yet be
revenged? People like him do not usually take cowhidings
quietly,” the doctor asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, I’ve no fear of him, for what can he do to me?
Besides, I should not wonder if he were dead. We have
never heard of him since that letter to father,” was
Everard’s reply, and after a moment his companion continued:</p>

<p class='c011'>“And this girl,—is she pretty and bright, and how
old is she now?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Rossie must be thirteen,” Everard said, “and the
very nicest girl in the world, but as to being pretty, she
is too thin for that, though she has splendid eyes, large
and brilliant, and black as midnight, and what is peculiar
for such eyes, her hair, which ripples all over her
head, is a rich chestnut brown, with a tinge of gold upon
it when seen in the sunlight. Her hair is her great
beauty, and I should not be surprised if she grew to be
quite a handsome woman.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very likely;—excuse me, Mr. Forrest,” and the doctor
spoke respectfully, nay, deferentially, “excuse me if
I appear too familiar. We have talked together so freely
that you do not seem a stranger, and friendships, you
know, are not always measured by time.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Everard bowed, and, foolish boy that he was, felt
flattered by this giant of a man, who went on:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Possibly this little Rossie may some day be the
daughter of the house in earnest.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What do you mean? that my father will adopt her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>regularly?” Everard asked, as he lifted his clear, honest
eyes inquiringly to the face of his companion, who, finding
that in dealing with a frank, open nature like Everard’s
he must speak out plain, replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I mean, perhaps you will marry her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I marry Rossie! Absurd! Why, I would as soon
think of marrying my sister,” and Everard laughed
merrily at the idea.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Such a thing is possible,” returned the doctor,
“though your father might object on the score of family,
if that brother is such a scamp. I imagine he is rather
proud; your father, I mean,—not that brother.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Rossie’s family is well enough for anything I know
to the contrary,” said Everard. “Father would not object
to that, though he is infernally proud. He is a
South Carolinian, born in Charleston, and boasts of
Southern blood and Southern aristocracy, while mother
is a Bostonian, of the bluest dye, and both would think
the Queen of England honored to have a daughter
marry their son. Nothing would put father in such a
passion as for me to make what he thought a <i><span lang="it">mesalliance</span></i>.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I see, and yet——”</p>

<p class='c011'>The doctor did not finish the sentence, but looked
instead down into the garden where Josephine was flitting
among the flowers.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Miss Fleming is a very beautiful girl,” the doctor
said, at last, and Everard responded heartily:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, the handsomest I ever saw.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And rumor says you two are very fond of each
other,” was the doctor’s next remark, which brought a
blush like that of a young girl to Everard’s cheek, but
elicited no reply, for there was beginning to dawn upon his
mind a suspicion that his inmost secrets were being wrung
from him by this smooth-tongued stranger, who, quick
to detect every fluctuation of thought and feeling in
another, saw he had gone far enough, and having learned
all he cared to know, he arose to go, and after a good morning
to Everard and a few soft speeches to Josephine,
walked away and left the pair alone.</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
The long hall, or rather ball-room, of the old
Eagle tavern was crowded to its utmost
capacity, for the entertainment had been
talked of for a long time, and as the proceeds
were to help buy a fire-engine, the whole town
was interested, and the whole town was there. First on
the programme came tableaux and charades, interspersed
with music from the glee club, and music from the
Ellicott band, and then there was a great hush of expectation
and eager anticipation, for the gem of the performance
was reserved for the last.</p>

<p class='c011'>Behind the scenes, in the little anterooms where the
dressing, and powdering, and masking, and jesting were
all going on promiscuously, Josephine Fleming was in a
state of great excitement, but hers was a face and complexion
which never looked red or tired. She was,
perhaps, a shade paler than her wont, and her eyes were
brighter and bluer as she stood before the little two-foot
glass, giving the last touches to her bridal toilet.</p>

<p class='c011'>And never was real bride more transcendently lovely
than Josephine Fleming when she stood at last ready
and waiting to be called, in her fleecy tarlatan, with her
long vail sweeping back from her face, and showing like
a silver net upon her golden hair. And Everard, in his
dark, boyish beauty, looked worthy of the bride, as he
bent over her and whispered something in her ear which
had reference to a future day when this they were doing
in jest should be done in sober earnest. For a moment
they were alone. Dr. Matthewson had managed to
clear the little room, and now he came to them and
said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I feel I shall be doing wrong to let this go any
further without telling you that I have a right to make
the marriage lawful, if you say so. A few years ago I was
a clergyman in good and regular standing in the Methodist
Episcopal Church at Clarence, in the western part of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>this State. I am <em>not</em> in regular and good standing now;
the world, the flesh, and the devil, especially the latter,
got the upper hand of me, but I still have the power to
marry you fast and strong. You two are engaged, I
hear. Suppose, for the fun of it, we make this marriage
real? What do you say?”</p>

<p class='c011'>He was looking at Everard, but he spoke to Josephine,
feeling that hers would be the more ready assent of the
two. She was standing with her arm linked in Everard’s,
and at Dr. Matthewson’s words she lifted her blue eyes
coyly to her lover’s face, and said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wouldn’t that be capital, and shouldn’t we steal a
march on everybody?”</p>

<p class='c011'>She waited for him to speak, but his answer did not
come at once. It is true he had said something of this
very nature to her only the night before, but now, when
it came to him as something which might be if he chose,
he started as if he had been stung, and the color faded
from his lips, which quivered as he said, with an effort
to smile:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’d like it vastly, only you see I am not through
college, and I should be expelled at once. Then father
never would forgive me. He’d disinherit me, sure.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hardly so bad as that, I think,” spoke the soothing
voice of the doctor, while one of Josephine’s hands
found its way to Everard’s, which it pressed softly, as she
said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“We can keep it a secret, you know, till you are
through college, and it would be such fun.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Half an hour before Everard had gone with the doctor
to the bar and taken a glass of wine, which was
beginning to affect his brain and cloud his better judgment,
while Josephine was still looking at him with those
great, dreamy, pleading eyes, which always affected him
so strangely. She was very beautiful, and he loved her
with all the strength of his boyish, passionate nature.
So it is not strange that the thought of possessing her
years sooner than he had dared to hope made his young
blood stir with ecstasy, even though he knew it was
wrong. He was like the bird in the toiler’s snare, and
he stood irresolute, trying to stammer out he hardly
knew what, except that it had some reference to his
father, and mother, and Rossie, for he thought of her in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>that hour of his temptation, and wondered how he could
face her with that secret on his soul.</p>

<p class='c011'>“They are growing impatient. Don’t you hear them
stamping? What are you waiting for?” came from the
manager of the play, as he put his head into the room,
while a prolonged and deafening call greeted their ears
from the expectant audience.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, let’s go,” Josephine said, “and pray forget
that I almost asked you to marry me and you refused. I
should not have done it only it is Leap-year, you know,
and I have a right; but it was all in joke, of course. I
didn’t mean it. Don’t think I did, Everard.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Oh, how soft and beautiful were the eyes swimming
in tears and lifted so pleadingly to Everard’s face! It
was more than mortal man could do to withstand them,
and Everard went down before them body and soul. His
father’s bitter anger,—so sure to follow, his mother’s
grief and disappointment in her son, and Rossie’s childish
surprise were all forgotten, or, if remembered, weighed
as nought compared with this lovely creature with the
golden hair and eyes of blue, looking so sweetly and tenderly
at him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll do it, by George!” he said, and the hot blood
came surging back to his face. “It will be the richest
kind of a lark. Tie as tight as you please. I am more
than willing.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He was very much excited, and Josephine was trembling
like a leaf. Only Dr. Matthewson was calm as he
asked: “Do you really mean it, and will you stand to
it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Are you ever coming?” came angrily this time from
the manager, who was losing all patience.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I mean it, and will stand to it,” Everard said,
and so went on to his fate.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a cheer, followed by a deep hush, when the
curtain was withdrawn, disclosing the bridal party upon
the stage, fitted up to represent a modern drawing-room,
with groups of gayly-dressed people standing together, and
in their midst Everard and Josephine, <em>she</em> radiantly beautiful,
with a look of exultation on her face, but a tumult
of conflicting emotions in her heart, as she wondered if
Dr. Matthewson had told the truth, and was authorized
to marry her really, and if Everard would stand to it or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>repudiate the act; <em>he</em>, with a face white now as ashes,
and a voice which was husky in its tone when, to the
question: “Dost thou take this woman for thy wedded
wife? Dost thou promise to love her, and cherish her,
both in sickness and in health, and, forsaking all others,
keep thee only unto her?” he answered: “I do,” while
a chill like the touch of death ran through every nerve
and made him icy cold.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was not the <em>lark</em> he thought it was going to be; it
was like some dreadful nightmare, and he could not at
all realize what he was doing or saying. Even Josephine’s
voice, when she too said, “I will,” sounded very
far away, as did Matthewson’s concluding words: “According
to the authority vested in me I pronounce you
man and wife. What God hath joined together let no
man put asunder.”</p>

<p class='c011'>How real it seemed to the breathless audience—so real
that Agnes Fleming, sitting far back in the hall, in her
faded muslin and old-fashioned bonnet, involuntarily
rose to her feet and raised her hand with a deprecating
gesture as if to forbid the bans. But her mother pulled
her down to her seat, and in a low whisper bade her
keep quiet.</p>

<p class='c011'>And so the play went on, and was over at last; the
crowd dispersed, and the tired actors, sleepy and cross,
gathered up the paraphernalia scattered everywhere, and
went to their several homes. Everard and Josephine
were the last to leave, for she had so much to say, and
so much to see to, that it was after twelve, and the
summer moon was high in the heavens ere they started
at last for home, accompanied by the young man with
whom Everard was staying in Ellicottville, and who had
come down to the play.</p>

<p class='c011'>It had been arranged that young Stafford should pass
the night at Mrs. Fleming’s, and when the party reached
the cottage they found a supper prepared for them, of
which hot coffee and sherry formed a part, and under
the combined effects of the two Everard’s spirits began
to rise, and when at last he said good-night to Josephine
and went with his friend to his room, he was much like
himself, and felt that it would not be a very bad state of
affairs, after all, if it should prove that Josephine was
really his wife. It would only be expediting matters a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>little, and the secret would be so romantic and unusual.
Still, he was conscious of a feeling of unrest and disinclination
to talk, and declared his intention of plunging
into bed at once.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Perhaps you’d better read this first,” Stafford said,
handing him a telegram. “It came this morning, and I
brought it with me, but would not give it to you till
after the play, for fear it might contain bad news.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Now young Stafford knew perfectly well the nature
of the telegram, for he had been in the office when
it came, and decided not to deliver it until the play was
over. It was from Everard’s father, and read as follows:</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>To J. Everard Forrest, Jr.</span>—Your mother is very
sick. Come immediately.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>J. E. Forrest.</span>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Stafford,” and Everard’s voice was like the cry
of a wounded child, “why didn’t you give me this
before. There was a train left at five o’clock. I could
have taken it, and saved——”</p>

<p class='c011'>He did not finish the sentence, for he could not put
into words the great horror of impending evil which had
fallen upon him with the receipt of that telegram. Indeed,
he could not define to himself the nature of his
feelings. He only knew that he wished he had gone
home in answer to Rossie’s summons, instead of coming
to Holburton. And in this he meant no disloyalty to
Josephine, nor attributed any blame to her; and when,
next morning, after a troubled night, in which no sleep
visited his weary eyes, he met her at the breakfast-table
looking as bright, and fresh, and pretty as if she too, had
not kept a sleepless vigil, he experienced a delicious
feeling of ownership in her, and for a few moments felt
willing to defy the whole world, if by so doing he could
claim her as his, then and there. He told her of the
telegram, and said he must take the first train west,
which left in about two hours, and Josephine’s eyes
instantly filled with tears, as she said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am so sorry for you, and I hope your mother will
recover. I have always wished to see her so much.
Would you mind telling her of me, and giving my love
to her?”</p>

<p class='c011'>This was after breakfast, when they stood together
under the vine-wreathed porch, each with a thought of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>last night’s ceremony in their minds, and each loth to
speak of it first. Stafford had gone to the hotel to settle
his bill of the previous day and make some inquiries
about the connection of the trains, and thus the family
were alone when Dr. Matthewson appeared, wearing his
blandest smile, and addressing Josephine as Mrs. Forrest,
and asking her how she found herself after the play.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the sound of that name given to Josephine as if
she had a right to it, a scarlet flame spread over Everard’s
face, and he felt the old horror and dread of the night
creeping over him again. Now was the time to know
the worst or the best,—whichever way he chose to put
it,—and as calmly as possible under the circumstances, he
turned to Dr. Matthewson and asked:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Were you in earnest in what you said last night?
Had you a right to marry us, and is Josephine my wife?”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was the first time he had put it into words, and as
if the very name of wife made her dearer to him, he
wound his arm around her and waited the doctor’s answer,
which came promptly and decidedly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Most assuredly she is your lawful wife! You took
her with your full consent, knowing I could marry you,
and I have brought your certificate, which I suppose the
lady will hold.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He handed a neatly-folded paper to Josephine, who,
with Everard looking over her shoulder, read to the
effect that on the evening of July 17th, in the Village
Hall at Holburton, the Rev. John Matthewson married
J. Everard Forrest, Jr. of Rothsay, Ohio, to Miss Josephine
Fleming of Holburton.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is all right, I believe, and only needs the names
of your mother and sister as witnesses to make it valid,
in case the marriage is ever contested,” Matthewson said,
and this time he looked pitilessly at Everard, who was
staring blankly at the paper in Josephine’s hands, and if
it had been his death-warrant he was reading he could
scarcely have been paler.</p>

<p class='c011'>Something in his manner must have communicated
itself to Josephine, for in real or feigned distress she
burst into tears, and laying her head on his arm, sobbed
out:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Everard, you are not sorry I am your wife!
If you are, I shall wish I was dead!”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>“No, no, Josey, not sorry you are my wife,” he said, “I
could not be that; only I am so young, and have two years
more in college,—and if this thing were known I should
be expelled, and father would never forgive me, or let
me have a dollar again; so, you see it is a deuced scrape
after all.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He was as near crying as he well could be and not
actually give way, and Matthewson was regarding him
with a cool, exultant expression in his cruel eyes, when
Mrs. Fleming appeared, asking what it meant.</p>

<p class='c011'>Very briefly Dr. Matthewson explained the matter
to her, and laying his hand on Everard’s arm said, laughingly:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have the honor of presenting to you your son, who,
I believe, acknowledges your claim upon him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a gleam of triumph in Mrs. Fleming’s
eyes, but she affected to be astonished and indignant that
her daughter should have lent herself to an act which
Mr. Forrest was perhaps already sorry for.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are mistaken,” Everard said, and his young
manhood asserted itself in Josephine’s defense. “Your
daughter was not more to blame than myself. We both
knew what we were doing, and I am not sorry, except
for the trouble in which it would involve me if it were
known at once that I was married.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It need not be known, except to ourselves,” Mrs.
Fleming answered, quickly. “What is done cannot be
undone, but we can make the best of it, and I promise
that the secret shall be kept as long as you like. Josey
will remain with me as she is, and you will return to college
and graduate as if last night had never been. Then,
when you are in a position to claim your wife you can do
so, and acknowledge it to your father.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She settled it rapidly and easily, and Everard felt
his spirits rise thus to have some one think and decide
for him. It was not distasteful to know that Josey was
his, and he smoothed caressingly the bowed head, still
resting on his arm, where Josey had laid it. It would be
just like living a romance all the time, and the interviews
they might occasionally have would be all the sweeter
because of the secrecy. After all, it was a pretty nice
lark, and he felt a great deal better, and watched Mrs.
Fleming and Agnes as they signed their names to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>certificate, and noticed how the latter trembled and how
pale she was as, with what seemed to him a look of pity
for him, she left the room and went back to her dish-washing
in the kitchen.</p>

<p class='c011'>Everard had spent some weeks in Mrs. Fleming’s
family as a boarder, and had visited there occasionally,
but he had never noticed or thought particularly of
Agnes, except, indeed, as the household drudge, who was
always busy from morning till night, washing, ironing,
baking, dusting, with her sleeves rolled up and her broad
check apron tied around her waist. She had a limp in
her left foot, and a weakness in her left arm which gave
her a helpless, peculiar appearance; and the impression
he had of her, if any, was that she was unfortunate in
mind as well as body, fit only to minister to others as she
always seemed to be doing. She had never addressed a
word to him without being first spoken to, and he was
greatly surprised when, after Dr. Matthewson was gone,
and Mrs. Fleming and Josephine had for a moment left
him alone in the room, she came to him and putting her
hand on his, said in a whisper, “Did you really mean it,
or was it an accident? a joke? and do you want to get
out of it? because, if you do, now is the time. Say you
didn’t mean it! Say you won’t stand it, and there surely
will be some way out. I can help,—weak as I am. It is
a pity, and you so young.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She was looking fixedly at him, and he saw that her
eyes were soft, and dark, and sad in their expression, as
if for them there was no brightness or sunshine in all the
wide world,—nothing but the never-ending dish-washing
in the kitchen, or serving in the parlor. But there was
another expression in those sad eyes, a look of truth and
honesty, which made him feel intuitively that she was a
person to be trusted even to the death, and had he felt
any misgivings then, he would have told her so unhesitatingly;
but he had none, and he answered her:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do not wish to get out of it, Agnes, I am satisfied;
only it must be a secret for a long, long time. Remember
that, and your promise not to tell.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I’ll remember, and may God help you!” she
answered, as she turned away, leaving him to wonder at
her manner, which puzzled and troubled him a little.
But it surely had nothing to do with Josephine, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>came to him just before he left for the train, and said so
charmingly and tearfully:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am so mortified and ashamed when I remember
how eagerly I seemed to respond to Dr. Matthewson’s
proposition that we be married in earnest. You must
have thought me so forward and bold; but, believe me,
I did not mean it, or consider what I was saying; so
when you are gone don’t think of me as a brazen-faced
creature who asked you to marry her, will you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>What answer could he give her except to assure her
that he esteemed her as everything lovely and good, and
he believed that he did when at last he said good-by, and
left her kissing her hand to him as she stood in the doorway
under the spreading hop vine, the summer sunshine
falling in flecks upon her golden hair, and her blue eyes
full of tears. So he saw her last, and this was the picture
he took with him as he sped away to the westward
toward his home, and which helped to stifle his judgment
and reason whenever they protested against what he had
done, but it could not quite smother the fear and dread
at his heart when he reflected what the consequences of
this rash marriage would be should his father find it out.</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
Just where it was located is not my purpose to
tell, except that it was in the southern part
of Ohio, in one of those pretty little towns
which skirt the river, and that from the bluff
on which it stood you could look across the
water into the green fields and fertile plains of the fair
State of Kentucky.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a large, rambling house of dark gray stone,
with double piazza on the front and river side, and huge
chimneys, with old-time fire-places, where cheery wood
fires burned always when the wind was chill. There was
the usual wide hall of the South, with doors opening
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>front and rear, and on one side the broad oak staircase
and square landing two-thirds of the way up, where stood
the tall, old-fashioned clock, which had ticked there for
fifty years, and struck the hour when the first Forrest,
the father of the present proprietor, brought home his
bride, a fair Southern girl, who drooped and pined
in her Northern home until her husband took her
back to her native city, Charleston, where she died when
her boy was born. This boy, the father of our hero, was
christened James Everard, in the grim old church, St.
Michael’s, and the years of his boyhood were passed in
Charleston, except on the few occasions when he visited his
father, who lived at Forrest House without other companionship
than his horses and dogs, and the bevy of black
servants he had brought from the South.</p>

<p class='c011'>When James was nearly twenty-one his father died,
and then the house was closed until the heir was married,
and came to it with a sweet, pale-faced Bostonian, of
rare culture and refinement, who introduced into her new
home many of the fashions and comforts of New England,
and made the house very attractive to the educated
families in the neighborhood.</p>

<p class='c011'>Between the lady and her husband, however, there
was this point of difference;—while she would, if possible,
have changed, and improved, and modernized the
house, he clung to everything savoring of the past, and
though liberal in his expenditures where his table, and
wines, and horses, and servants were concerned, he held
a tight purse-string when it came to what he called luxuries
of any kind. What had been good enough for his
father was good enough for him, he said, when his wife
proposed new furniture for the rooms which looked so
bare and cheerless. Matting and oil-cloth were better
than carpets for his muddy boots and muddier dogs,
while curtains and shades were nuisances and only served
to keep out the light of heaven. There were blinds at all
the windows, and if his wife wished for anything more
she could hang up her shawl or apron when she was dressing
and afraid of being seen.</p>

<p class='c011'>He did, however, give her five hundred dollars to do
with as she pleased, and with that and her exquisite taste
and Yankee ingenuity, she transformed a few of the dark,
musty old rooms into the coziest, prettiest apartments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>imaginable, and, with the exception of absolutely necessary
repairs and supplies, that was the last, so far as expenditures
for furniture were concerned.</p>

<p class='c011'>As the house had been when James Everard, Jr., was
born, so it was now when he was twenty years old. But
what it lacked in its interior adornments was more than
made up in the grounds, which covered a space of three
or four acres, and were beautiful in the extreme.</p>

<p class='c011'>Here the judge lavished his money without stint, and
people came from miles around to see the place, which
was at its best that warm July morning when, tired and
worn with his rapid journey, Everard entered the highway
gate, and walked up the road to the house, under
the tall maples which formed an arch over his head.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was very still about the house, and two or three
dogs lay in the sunshine asleep on the piazza. At the
sound of footsteps they awoke, and recognizing their
young master, ran toward him, with a bark of welcome.</p>

<p class='c011'>The windows of his mother’s room were open, and at
the bark of the dogs a girlish face was visible for an instant,
then disappeared from view, and Rosamond Hastings
came out to meet him, looking very fresh and
sweet in her short gingham dress and white apron, with
her rippling hair tied with a blue ribbon, and falling
down her back.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Mr. Everard,” she cried, as she gave him her
hand, “I am so glad you have come. Your mother has
wanted you so much. She is a little better this morning,
and asleep just now; so come in here and rest.
You are tired, and worn, and pale. Are you sick?” and
she looked anxiously into the handsome face, where
even she saw a change, for the shadow of his secret was
there, haunting every moment of his life.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No; I’m just used up, and so hungry,” he said, as
he followed her into the cool family room, looking out
upon the river, which she had made bright with flowers
in expectation of his coming.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hungry, are you?” she said. “I’m so glad, for
there’s the fattest little chicken waiting to be broiled for
you, and we have such splendid black and white raspberries.
I’m going to pick them now, while you wash
and brush yourself. You will find everything ready in
your room, with some curtains, and tidies on the chairs.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>I did it myself, hoping you’d find it pleasant, and stay
home all the vacation, even if your mother gets better,
she is so happy to have you here. Will you go up
now?”</p>

<p class='c011'>He went to the room which had always been his,—a
large, airy chamber, which, with nothing modern or
expensive in it, looked cool and pretty, with its clean
matting, snowy bed, fresh muslin curtains, and new blue
and white tidies on the high-backed chairs, all showing
Rossie’s handiwork. Rossie had been in Miss Beatrice
Belknap’s lovely room furnished with blue, and thought
it a little heaven, and tried her best to make Mr.
Everard’s a blue room too, though she had nothing to do
it with except the tidies, and toilet set, and lambrequins
made of plain white muslin bordered with strips of blue
cambric. The material for this she had bought with
her own allowance, at the cost of some personal sacrifice;
and when it was all done, and the two large blue vases
were filled with flowers and placed upon the mantel, she
felt that it was almost equal to Miss Belknap’s, and that
Mr. Everard, as she always called him, was sure to like
it. And he did like it, and breathed more freely, as if he
were in a purer, more wholesome atmosphere than that
of the brown house in far-off Holburton, where he had
left his secret and his wife. It came to him with a
sudden wrench of pain in his quiet room,—the difference
between Josephine and all his early associates and surroundings.
She was not like anything at the Forrest
House, though she was marvelously beautiful and fair,—so
much fairer than little Rossie, whose white cape
bonnet he could see flitting among the bushes in the
garden, where in the hot sunshine she soiled and pricked
her fingers gathering berries for him. He had a photograph
of Josephine, and he took it out and looked at the
great blue eyes and fair, blonde face, which seemed to
smile on him, and saying to himself, “She is very
lovely,” went down to the sitting-room, where Rossie
brought him his breakfast.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was so hot in the dining-room, she said, and Aunt
Axie was so out of sorts this morning, that she was
going to serve his breakfast there in the bay window,
where the breeze came cool from the river. So she
brought in the tray of dishes, and creamed his coffee,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>and sugared his berries, and carved his chicken, as if he
had been a prince, and she his lawful slave.</p>

<p class='c011'>At Mrs. Fleming’s he had also been treated like a
prince, but there it was lame Agnes who served, with her
sleeves rolled up, and Josephine had acted the part of the
fine lady, and never to his recollection had she soiled her
hands with household work of any kind. How soft and
white they were,—while Rossie’s hands were thin and
tanned from exposure to the sun, and stained and
scratched, with a rag around one thumb which a cruel
thorn had torn; but what deft, nimble hands they were,
nevertheless, and how gladly they waited upon this
tired, indolent young man, who took it as a matter of
course, for had not Rossie Hastings ministered to him
since she was old enough to hunt up his missing cap, and
bring him the book he was reading. Now, as she flitted
about, urging him to eat, she talked to him incessantly,
asking if he had received her letter and its contents
safely,—if it was very pleasant at Ellicottville with his
friend Stafford, and if,—she did not finish that question,
but her large black eyes, clear as crystal, looked anxiously
at him, and he knew what she meant.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, Rossie,” he said, laughingly, “I do not owe
a dollar to anybody, except your dear little self, and that
I mean to pay with compound interest; and I haven’t
been in a single scrape,—that is, not a very bad one,
since I went back;” and a flush crept to the roots of his
hair as he wondered what Rosamond would think if she
knew just the scrape he was in.</p>

<p class='c011'>And why should she not know? Why didn’t he tell
her, and have her help him keep the secret tormenting
him so sorely? He knew he could trust her, for he had
done so many a time and she had not betrayed him, but
stood bravely between him and his irascible father, who,
forgetting that he once was young, was sometimes hard
and severe with his wayward son. Yes, he would tell
Rossie, and so make a friend for Josephine, but before
he had decided how to begin, Rosamond said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m so glad you are doing better, for——” here she
hesitated and colored painfully, while Everard said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, go on. What is it? Do you mean the governor
rides a high horse on account of my misdemeanors?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>“Yes, Mr. Everard, just that. He is dreadful when
you write for more money, which he says you squander
on cigars, and fast horses, and fine clothes, and <em>girls</em>;
he actually said girls, but my,—your mother told him she
knew you were not the kind of person to think of girls,
and you so young; absurd!”</p>

<p class='c011'>And Rossie pursed up her little mouth as if it were
a perfectly preposterous idea for Everard Forrest to be
thinking of the girls!</p>

<p class='c011'>The young man laughed a low, musical laugh, and
replied, “I don’t know about that. I should say it was
just in my line. There are ever so many pretty girls in
Ellicottville and Holburton, and one of them is so very
beautiful that I’m half tempted to run away with and
marry her. What would you think of that, Rossie?”</p>

<p class='c011'>For a moment the matter-of-fact Rossie looked at
him curiously, and then replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I should think you crazy, and you not through
college. I believe your father would disinherit you, and
serve you right, too.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And you, Rossie; wouldn’t you stand by me and
help me if I got into such a muss?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Never!” and Rossie spoke with all the decision and
dignity of thirty. “It would kill your mother, too. I
sometimes think she means you for Miss Belknap; she <em>is</em>
so handsome this summer!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Without her hair?” Everard asked, and Rossie
replied, “Yes, without her hair. She has a wig, but
does not quite like it. She means to get another.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And she offered fifty dollars for your hair!” Everard
continued, stroking with his hand the chestnut
brown tresses flowing down Rossie’s back.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, she did; but I could not part with my hair
even to oblige her. Of course I should give it to her,
not sell it, but I can’t spare it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>What an unselfish child she was, Everard thought,
and yet she was so unlike the golden-haired Josephine,
who would make fun of such a plain, simple, unformed
girl as Rosamond, and call her green and awkward and
countrified; and perhaps she was all these, but she was
so good, and pure, and truthful that he felt abashed before
her and shrank from the earnest, truthful eyes that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>rested so proudly on him, lest they should read more than
he cared to have them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Outside, in the hall, there was the sound of a heavy
step, and the next moment there appeared in the door
a tall, heavily-built man of fifty, with iron-gray hair and
keen, restless eyes, which always seemed on the alert to
discover something hidden, and drag it to the light.
Judge Forrest meant to be a just man, but, like many
just men, when the justice is not tempered with mercy,
he was harsh and hard with those who did not come up
to his standard of integrity, and seldom made allowances
for one’s youth or inexperience, or the peculiar
temptations which might have assailed them. Though
looked up to as the great man of the town, he was far less
popular with the people of Rothsay than his scamp of a
son, with whom they thought him unnecessarily strict
and close. It was well known that there was generally
trouble between them and always on the money question,
for Everard was a spendthrift, and scattered his dollars
right and left with a reckless generosity and thoughtlessness,
while the judge was the reverse, and gave out every
cent not absolutely needed with an unwillingness which
amounted to actual stinginess. And now he stood at
the door, tall, grand-looking, and cold as an icicle, and
his first greeting was:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I thought I should track you by the tobacco smoke;
they told me you were here. How do you do, sir?”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was strange the effect that voice had upon Everard,
who, from an indolent, care-for-nothing, easy-going
youth was transformed into a circumspect, dignified
young man, who rose at once, and, taking his father’s
hand, said that he was very well, had come on the morning
train from Cleveland, and had started as soon as he
could after receiving the telegram.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It must have been delayed, then. You ought to
have had it Wednesday morning,” Judge Forrest replied:
and blushing like a girl Everard said that it did reach
Ellicottville Wednesday, but he was in Holburton, just
over the line in New York.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And what were you doing at Holburton?” the
father asked, always suspicious of some new trick or
escapade for which he would have to pay.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I was invited there to an entertainment,” Everard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>said, growing still redder and more confused. “You
know I boarded there a few weeks last summer, and have
acquaintances, so I went down the night before, and
Stafford came the next day and brought the telegram,
but did not tell me till the play was over and we were
in our room; then it was too late, but I took the first
train in the morning. I hope my delay has not made
mother worse. I am very sorry, sir.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He had made his explanation, which his father accepted
without a suspicion of the chasm bridged over in
silence.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You have seen your mother, of course,” was his
next remark, and, still apologetically, nay, almost abjectly,
for Everard was terribly afraid of his father, he
replied, “She was sleeping when I came, and Rossie
thought I’d better not disturb her, but have my breakfast
first. I have finished now, and will go to her at once if
she is awake.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He had put Rossie in the gap, knowing that she was
a tower of strength between himself and his father.
During the years she had been in the family Rossie had
become very dear to the cold, stern judge, who was
kinder and gentler to her than to any living being,
except, indeed, his dying wife, to whom he was, in his
way, sincerely attached.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, very right and proper that you should have
your breakfast first, and not disturb her. Rossie, see if
she is now awake,” he said, and in his voice there was a
kindliness which Everard was quick to note, and which
made his pulse beat more naturally, while there suddenly
woke within him an intense desire to stand well with his
father, between whom and himself there had been so
much variance.</p>

<p class='c011'>For Josephine’s sake he must have his father’s good
opinion, or he was ruined, and though it cost him a tremendous
effort to do so, the moment Rosamond left the
room, he said: “Father, I want to tell you now, because
I think you will be glad to know, that I’ve come home
and left no debt, however small, for you to pay. And I
mean to do better. I really do, father, and quit my fast
associates, and study so hard that when I am graduated
you and mother will be proud of me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The flushed, eager face, on which, young as it was,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>there were marks of revels and dissipation, was very
handsome and winning, and the dark eyes were moist
with tears as the boy finished his confession, which told
visibly upon the father.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, yes, my son. I’m glad; I’m glad; but your
poor mother will not be here when you graduate. She is
going from us fast.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And under cover of the dying mother’s name, the
judge vailed his own emotions of softening toward
Everard, whose heart was lighter and happier than it had
been since that night when Matthewson’s voice had said,
“I pronounce you man and wife.” And he would be a
man worthy of the wife, and his mother should live to
see it, and to see Josephine, too, and love her as a daughter.
She was not dying; she must not die, when he
needed and loved her so much, he thought, as, at a word
from Rosamond, he went to the sick room where his
mother lay. What a sweet, dainty little woman she was,
with such a lovely expression on the exquisitely chiseled
features, and how the soft brown eyes, so like the son’s,
brightened at the sight of her boy, who did not shrink
from her as he did from his father. She knew all his
faults, and that under them there was a noble, manly
nature, and she loved him so much.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Everard!” she cried, “I am so glad you have
come. I feared once I should never see you again.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He had his arms around her, and was kissing her
white face, which, for the moment, glowed with what
seemed to be the hue of health, and so misled him into
thinking her better than she was.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now that I have come, mother, you will be well
again,” he said, hanging fondly over her, and looking
into the dear face which had never worn a frown for
him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, Everard,” she said, as her wasted fingers
threaded his luxuriant hair, “I shall never be well again.
It’s only now a matter of time; a few days or weeks at
the most, and I shall be gone from here forever, to that
better home, where I pray Heaven you will one day meet
me. Hush, hush, my child; don’t cry like that,” she
added, soothingly, for, struck with the expression on her
white, pinched face, from which all the color had faded,
and which told him the truth more forcibly than she had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>done, Everard had felt suddenly that his mother was
going from him, and nothing in all the wide world could
ever fill her place.</p>

<p class='c011'>Laying his head upon her pillow he sobbed a few
moments like a child, while the memory of all the errors
of his past life, all his waywardness and folly, rushed
into his mind like a mountain, crushing him with its magnitude.
But he was going to do better; he had told his
father so; he would tell it to his mother; and God would
not let her die, but give her back to him as a kind of reward
for his reformation. So he reasoned, and with the
hopefulness of youth grew calm, and could listen to what
his mother was saying to him. She was asking him of
his visit in Ellicottville, and if he had found it pleasant
there, just as Rossie had done, and he told her of the
play in Holburton, but for which he should have been
with her sooner, and told her of his complete reform, he
called it, although it had but just begun. He had abjured
forever all his wild associates; he had kept out of
debt; he was going to study and win the first honors of
his class; he was going to be a man worthy of such a
mother. And she, the mother, listening rapturously,
believed it all; that is, believed in the noble man he
would one day be, though she knew there would be many
a slip, many a backward step, but in the end he would
conquer, and from the realms of bliss she might, perhaps,
be permitted to look down and see him all she hoped him
to be. Over and above all he said to her was a thought
of Josephine. His mother ought to know of her, and he
must tell her, but not in the first moments of meeting.
He would wait till to-morrow, and then make a clean
breast of it.</p>

<p class='c011'>He wrote to Josephine that night just a few brief
lines, to tell her of his safe arrival home and of his
mother’s illness, more serious than he feared.</p>

<p class='c013'>“My dear little wife,” he began. “It seems so funny
to call you wife, and I cannot yet quite realize that you
are mine, but I suppose it is true. I reached home this
morning quite overcome with the long, dusty ride; found
mother worse than I expected. Josie, I am afraid mother
is going to die, and then what shall I do, and who will
stand between me and father. I mean to tell her of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>you, for I think it will not be right to let her die in
ignorance of what I have done. I hope you are well.
Please write to me very soon. With kind regards to

<p class='c011'>It was not just the style of letter which young and

That afternoon Miss Beatrice Belknap drove
her pretty black ponies up the avenue to the
Forrest House. Miss Beatrice, or Bee, as she
was familiarly called by those who knew her
best, was an orphan and an heiress, and a belle
and a beauty, and twenty-one, and a distant relative of Mrs.
Forrest, whom she called Cousin Mary. People said she
was a little fast and a little peculiar in her ways of thinking
and acting, but charged it all to the French education
she had received in Paris, where she had lived from
the time she was six until she was eighteen, when, according
to her father’s will, she came into possession of
her large fortune, and returning to America came to
Rothsay, her old home, and brought with her all her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>dash and style, and originality of thought and character,
and the Rothsayites received her gladly, and were very
proud and fond of her, for there was about the bright
girl a sweet graciousness of manner which won all hearts,
even though they knew she was bored with their quiet
town and humdrum manner of living, and that at their
backs she laughed at their dress, and talk, and walk, and
sometimes, I am sorry to say it, laughed at their prayers
too, especially when good old Deacon Read or Sister
Baker took the lead in the little chapel on the corner,
where Bee was occasionally to be seen. Bee had no
preference for any church unless it were St. Peter’s, in
Rome, or St. Eustace, in Paris, where the music was so
fine and some of the young priests so handsome. So she
went where she listed, kneeling one Sunday in the square
pew at St. John’s, where her father had worshiped before
her, and where she had been baptized, and the Sunday
following patronizing the sect called the Nazarites, because,
as she expressed it, “she liked the excitement and
liked to hear them <em>holler</em>.” And once the daring girl
had “hollered” herself and had the “power,” and Sister
Baker had rejoiced over the new convert who, she said,
“carried with her weight and measure!” but when it was
whispered about that the whole was done for effect, just
to see what they would say, the Nazarites gave poor Bee
the go-by, and prayed for her as that wicked trifler until
it came to the building of their new church, when Bee,
who was a natural carpenter, and liked nothing better
than lath, and plaster, and rubbish, made the cause her
own, and talked, and consulted, and paced the ground
and drew a plan herself, which they finally adopted, and
gave them a thousand dollars besides. Then they forgave
the pretty sinner, who had so much good in her
after all, and Bee and Sister Rhoda Ann Baker were the
very best of friends, and more than once Rhoda Ann’s
plain Nazarite bonnet had been seen in the little phaeton
side by side with Bee’s stylish Paris hat, on which the
good woman scarcely dared to look lest it should move
her from her serene height of plainness and humility.</p>

<p class='c011'>In spite of her faults, Beatrice was very popular, and
nowhere was she more welcome than at the Forrest
House, where she was beloved by Mrs. Forrest and worshiped
by Rossie as a kind of divinity, though she did
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>not quite like all she did and said. Offers, many and
varied, Beatrice had had, both at home and abroad. She
might have been the wife of a senator. She might have
married her music-teacher and her dancing-master. She
might have been a missionary and taught the Feegee Islanders
how to read. She might have been a countess in
Rome, a baroness in Germany, and my lady in Edinburgh,
but she had said no to them all, and felt the hardest
wrench when she said it to the Feegee missionary,
and for aught anybody knew, was heart-whole and fancy-free
when she alighted from her phaeton at the door of
Forrest House the morning after Everard’s arrival. She
knew he was there, and with the spirit of coquetry so
much a part of herself she had made her toilet with a
direct reference to this young man whom she had not
seen for more than a year, and who, when joked about
marrying her, had once called her <em>old Bee Belknap</em>, and
wondered if any one supposed he would marry his
grandmother.</p>

<p class='c011'>Miss Bee had smiled sweetly on this audacious boy
who called her old and a grandmother, and had laid a
wager with herself that he should some day offer himself
to “old Bee Belknap,” and be refused! In case he
didn’t she would build a church in Omaha and support a
missionary there five years! She was much given to
building churches and supporting missionaries,—this
sprightly, dashing girl of twenty-one, who flashed, and
sparkled, and shone in the summer sunshine, like a diamond,
as she threw her reins over the backs of her two
ponies, Spitfire and Starlight, and giving each of them
a loving caress bade them stand still and not whisk their
tails too much even if the flies did bite them. Then,
with ribbons and laces streaming from her on all sides,
she went fluttering up the steps and into the broad hall
where Everard met her.</p>

<p class='c011'>Between him and herself there had been a strong
friendship since the time she first came from France, and
queened it over him on the strength of her foreign style
and a year’s seniority in age. From the very first she
had been much at the Forrest House, and had played
with Everard, and romped with him, and read with him,
and driven with him, and rowed with him upon the river,
and quarreled with him, too,—hot, fierce quarrels,—in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>which the girl generally had the best of it, inasmuch as
her voluble French, which she hurled at him with lightning
rapidity, had stunned and bewildered him; and
then they had made it up, and were the best of friends,
and more than one of the knowing ones in Rothsay had
predicted a union some day of the Forrest and Belknap
fortunes. Once, when such a possibility was hinted to
Everard, who was fresh from a hot skirmish with Bee,
he had, as recorded, called her <em>old</em>, and made mention of
his grandmother, and she had sworn to be revenged, and
was conscious all the time of a greater liking for the
heir of Forrest House than she had felt for any man
since the Feegee missionary sailed away with his Vermont
school-mistress, who wore glasses, and a brown
alpaca dress. Bee could have forgiven the glasses, but
the brown alpaca,—<em>never</em>, and she pitied the missionary
more than ever, thinking how he must contrast her Paris
gowns, which he had said were so pretty, with that
abominable brown garb of his bride.</p>

<p class='c011'>Everard had never quite fancied the linking of his
name with that of Beatrice in a matrimonial way, and it
had sometimes led him to assume an indifference which
he did not feel, but now, with Josephine between them
as an insurmountable barrier, he could act out his real
feelings of genuine liking for the gay butterfly, and he
met her with an unusual degree of cordiality, which she
was quick to note just as she had noted another change
in him. A skillful reader of the human face, she looked
in Everard’s, and saw something she could not define.
It was the shadow of his secret, and she could not interpret
it. She only felt that he was no longer a boy, but
a man, old even as his years, and that he was very glad
to see her, and looked his gladness to the full. Bee
Belknap was a born coquette, and would have flirted in
her coffin had the thing been possible, and now, during
the moment she stood in the hall with her hand in Everard’s,
she managed to make him understand how greatly
improved she found him, how delighted she was to see
him, and how inexpressibly dull and poky Rothsay was
without him. She did not say all this in words, but she
conveyed it to him with graceful gestures of her pretty
hands, and sundry expressive shrugs of her shoulders,
and Everard felt flattered and pleased, and for a few
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>moments forgot Josephine, while he watched this brilliant
creature as she flitted into the sick room, where her
manner suddenly changed, and she became quiet, and
gentle, and womanly, as she sat down by his mother’s
side, and asked how she was, and stroked and fondled
the thin, pale face, and petted the wasted hands which
sought hers so gladly. Bee Belknap always did sick
people good, and there was not a sick bed in all Rothsay,
from the loftiest dwelling to the lowest tenant house,
which she did not visit, making the rich ones more hopeful
and cheerful from the effect of her strong, sympathetic
nature, and dazzling, and bewildering, and gratifying
the poor, with whom she often left some tangible
proof of her presence.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You do me so much good; I am always better after
one of your calls,” Mrs. Forrest said to her; and then,
when Bee arose to go, and said, “May I take Everard
with me for a short drive?” she answered readily: “Yes,
do. I shall be glad for him to get the air.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And so Everard found himself seated at Beatrice’s
side, and whirling along the road toward the village, for
he wished to post his letter, and asked her to take him
first to the post-office.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What would she say if she knew?” he thought, and
it seemed to him as if the letter in his pocket must burn
itself through and show her the name upon it.</p>

<p class='c011'>And then he fell to comparing the two girls with
each other, and wondering why he should feel so much
more natural, as if in his own atmosphere and on his
good behavior, with Beatrice than he did with Josephine.
Both were beautiful; both were piquant and bright, but
still there was a difference. Beatrice never for a moment
allowed him to forget that she was a lady and he a gentleman;
never approached to anything like coarseness,
and he would as soon have thought of insulting his mother
as to have taken the slightest familiarity either by word
or act with Bee. Josephine, on the contrary, allowed great
latitude of word and action, and by her free-and-easy
manner often led him into doing and saying things for
which he would have blushed with shame had Beatrice,
or even Rossie Hastings, been there to see and hear.
Had Josephine lived in New York, or any other city, she
would have added one more to that large class of people
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>who laugh at our time-honored notions of propriety
and true, pure womanhood, and on the broad platform
of liberality and freedom sacrifice all that is sweetest
and best in their sex. As a matter of course her influence
over Everard was not good, and he had imbibed so
much of the subtle poison that some of his sensibilities
were blunted, and he was beginning to think that his
early ideas were prudish and nonsensical. But there
was something about Rosamond and Beatrice both which
worked as an antidote to the poison, and as he rode
along with the latter, and listened to her light, graceful
badinage, in which there was nothing approaching to
vulgarity, he was conscious of feeling more respect for
himself than he had felt in many a day.</p>

<p class='c011'>They had left the village now, and were out upon the
smooth river road, where they came upon a young M. D.
of Rothsay, who was jogging leisurely along in his high
sulky, behind his old sorrel mare. Beatrice knew the
doctor well, and more than once they had driven side by
side amid a shower of dust, along that fine, broad road,
and now, when she saw him and his sorry-looking nag,
the spirit of mischief and frolic awoke within her, and
she could no more refrain from some saucy remark concerning
his beast and challenging him to a trial of speed
than she could keep from breathing. Another moment
and they were off like the wind, and to Bee’s great surprise
old Jenny, the sorrel mare, who, in her long-past
youth had been a racer and swept the stakes at Cincinnati,
and who now at the sound of battle felt her old
blood rise, kept neck to neck with the fleet horses, Spitfire
and Starlight. At last old Jenny shot past them,
and in her excitement Beatrice rose, and standing upright,
urged her ponies on until Jenny’s wind gave out,
and Starlight and Spitfire were far ahead and rushing
down the turnpike at a break-neck speed, which rocked
the light phaeton from side to side and seemed almost to
lift it from the ground. It was a decided runaway now,
and people stopped to look after the mad horses and the
excited but not in the least frightened girl, who, still
standing upright, with her hat hanging down her back
and her wig a little awry, kept them with a firm hand
straight in the road, and said to the white-faced man
beside her, when he, too, sprang up to take the reins:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>“Sit down and keep quiet. I’ll see you safely through.
We can surely ride as fast as they can run. I rather
enjoy it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And so she did until they came to a point where the
road turned with the river, and where in the bend a little
school-house stood. It was just recess, and a troop of
boys came crowding out, whooping and yelling as only
boys can whoop and yell, when they saw the ponies, who,
really frightened now, shied suddenly, and reared high
in the air. After that came chaos and darkness to Everard,
and the next he knew he was lying on the grass,
with his head in Bee’s lap, and the blood flowing from a
deep gash in his forehead, just above the left eye. This
she was stanching with her handkerchief, and bathing
his face with the water the boys brought her in a tin
dipper from the school-house. Far off in the distance
the ponies were still running, and scattered at intervals
along the road were fragments of the broken phaeton,
together with Bee’s bonnet, and, worse than all, her wig.
But Bee did not know that she had lost it, or care for her
ruined phaeton. She did not know or care for anything,
except that Everard Forrest was lying upon the grass as
white and still as if he were really dead. But Everard
was not dead, and the doctor, who soon came up with
the panting, mortified Jennie, said it was only a flesh
wound, from which nothing serious would result. Then
Bee thought of her hair, which a boy had rescued from
a playful puppy who was doing his best to tear it in
pieces. The sight of her wig made Bee herself again,
and with many a merry joke at her own expense, she
mounted into a farmer’s wagon with Everard, and bade
the driver take them back to the Forrest House.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was Rossie who met them first, her black eyes
growing troubled and anxious when she saw the bandage
on Everard’s head. But he assured her it was nothing,
while Bee laughed over the adventure, and when
the judge would have censured his son, took all the
blame upon herself, and then, promising to call again in
the evening, went in search of her truant horses.</p>

That afternoon Mrs. Forrest seemed so much
better that even her husband began to hope,
when he saw the color on her cheek, and the
increased brightness of her eyes. But she was
not deceived. She knew the nature of her disease,
and that she had not long to live. So what she would
say to her son must be said without delay. Accordingly,
after lunch, she bade Rossie send him to her, and then
leave them alone together. Everard obeyed the summons
at once, though there was a shrinking fear in his
heart as he thought, “Now I must tell her of Josey,”
and wondered what she would say. Since his drive with
Beatrice it did not seem half so easy to talk of Josephine,
and that marriage ceremony was very far away,
and very unreal, too. His mother was propped up on her
pillows, and smiled pleasantly upon him as he took his
seat beside her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Everard,” she began, “there are so many things I
must say to you about the past and the future, and I
must say them now while I have the strength. Another
day may be too late.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He knew to what she referred, and with a protest
against it, told her she was not going to die; she
must not; she must live for him, who would be nothing
without her.</p>

<p class='c011'>Very gently she soothed him into quiet, and he listened
while she talked of all he had been, and all she
wished him to be in the future. Faithfully, but gently,
she went over with his faults, one by one, beseeching
him to forsake them, and with a bursting heart he promised
everything which she required, and told her again
of the reform already commenced.</p>

<p class='c011'>“God bless you, my boy, and prosper you as you
keep this pledge to your dying mother, and whether you
are great or not, may you be good and Christlike, and
come one day to meet me where sorrow is unknown,” she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>said to him finally; then, after a pause, she continued:
“There is one subject more of which, as a woman and
your mother, I must speak to you. Some day you will
marry, of course——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, mother,” and Everard started violently, while
the cold sweat stood in drops about his lips, but he could
say no more then, and his mother continued: “I have
thought many times who and what your wife would be,
and have pictured her often to myself, and loved her for
your sake; but I shall never see her, when she comes
here I shall be gone, and so I will speak of her now,
and say it is not my wish that you should wait many
years before marrying. I believe in early marriages,
where there is mutual love and esteem. Then you make
allowance more readily for each other’s habits and peculiarities.
I mean no disrespect to your father, he has
been kind to me, but I think he waited too long; there
were too many years between us; my feelings and ideas
were young, his middle-aged; better begin alike for
perfect unity. And, my boy, be sure you marry a lady.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A lady, mother?” Everard said, wondering if his
mother would call Josephine a lady.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, Everard,” she replied, “a lady in the true sense
of the word, a person of education and refinement, and
somewhere near your own rank in life. I never believed
in the Maud Muller poem, never was sorry that the
judge did not take the maiden for his wife. He might,
perhaps, never have blushed for <em>her</em>, but he would have
blushed for her family, and their likeness in his children’s
faces would have been a secret annoyance. I do not say
that every <i><span lang="it">mesalliance</span></i> proves unhappy, but it is better
to marry your equal, if you can, for a low-born person,
with low-born tastes, will, of necessity, drag you down
to her level.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She stopped a moment to rest, but Everard did not
speak for the fierce struggle in his heart. He <em>must</em> tell
her of Josephine, and could he say that she had no low-born
tastes? Alas, he could not, when he remembered
things which had dropped from her pretty lips so easily
and naturally, and at which he had laughed as at something
spicy and daring. His mother would call them
coarse, with all her innate refinement and delicacy, and
a shiver ran through him as he seemed to hear again the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>words “I pronounce you man and wife.” They were
always ringing in his ears, louder sometimes than at
others, and now they were so loud as almost to drown
the low voice which after a little went on:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do not believe in parents selecting companions for
their children, but surely I may suggest. You are not
obliged to follow my suggestion. I would have your
choice perfectly free,” she added, quickly, as she saw a
look of consternation on his face, and mistook its meaning.
“I have thought, and think still, that were I to
choose for you, it would be Beatrice.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Beatrice! Bee Belknap! mother,” and Everard
fairly gasped. “Bee Belknap is a great deal older than
I am.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Just a year, which is not much in this case. She
will not grow old fast, while you will mature early; the
disparity would never be thought of,” Mrs. Forrest said.
“Beatrice is a little wild, and full of fun and frolic, but
under all that is a deep-seated principle of propriety and
right, which makes her a noble and lovely character. I
should be willing to trust you with her, and your father’s
heart is quite set on this match. I may tell you now
that it has been in his mind for years, and I wish you to
please him, both for his sake and yours. I hope you
will think of it, Everard, and try to love Beatrice; surely
it cannot be hard to do that?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, mother,” Everard said, “but you seem to put
<em>her</em> out of the question entirely. Is she to have no choice
in the matter, and do you think that, belle and flirt as
she is, she would for a moment consider <em>me</em>, Ned Forrest,
whom she calls a boy, and ridicules unmercifully? She
would not have me, were I to ask her a thousand times.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think you may be wrong,” Mrs. Forrest said. “It
surely can’t be that you love some one else?” and she
looked at him searchingly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now was the time to speak of Josephine, if ever, and
while his heart beat so loudly that he could hear it, he
said, “Yes, mother, I do like some one else;—it is a
young girl in Holburton, where I staid last summer.
She is very beautiful. This is her picture,” and he passed
Josephine’s photograph to his mother, who studied it
carefully for two or three minutes; then turning her eyes
to her son she said: “She is beautiful, so far as features
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>and complexion are concerned, but I am greatly mistaken
in you if the original of this face can satisfy you long.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, mother, what fault have you to find with
her? Isn’t she a born lady?” Everard asked, a little
scornfully, for he was warming up in Josephine’s
defense.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t misunderstand what I mean by a lady,” Mrs.
Forrest said. “Birth has not all to do with it. Persons
may be born of the lowliest parentage, and in the
humblest shed, but still have that within them which
will refine, and soften, and elevate till the nobility within
asserts itself, and lifts them above their surroundings.
In this case,” and she glanced again at the picture, “the
inborn nobility, if there were any, has had time to assert
itself, and stamp its impress upon the face, and it has
not done that.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“For pity’s sake, mother, tell me what you see to
dislike so much in Josephine!” Everard burst out, indignantly.</p>

<p class='c011'>His mother knew he was angry, but she would not
spare him, lest a great misfortune should befall him.
She saw the face she looked upon was very fair, but
there was that about it from which she shrank intuitively,
her quick woman instinct telling her it was false as fair,
and not at all the face she would have in her boy’s home;
so she answered him unhesitatingly:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Shall I tell you the kind of person I fancy this girl
to be, judging from her picture? Her face is one to
attract young men like you, and she would try to attract
you, too, and the very manner with which she would do
it would be the perfection of art. There is a treacherous,
designing look in these eyes, so blue and dreamy,
and about the mouth there is a cruel, selfish expression
which I do not like. I do not believe she can be trusted.
And then, it may be a minor matter, I do not like her
style of dress. A really modest girl would not have sat
for her picture with so much exposure of neck and arms,
and so much jewelry. Surely you must have noticed
the immense chain and cross, and all the show of bracelets,
and pins, and ornaments in her hair.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Everard had thought of it, but he would not acknowledge
it, and his mother continued:</p>

<p class='c011'>“The whole effect is tawdry, and, excuse me for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>putting it so strongly, but it reminds me of the dollar
store, and the jewelry bought there. She cannot have
the true instincts of a lady. Who is she, Everard, and
where does she live?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Everard was terribly hurt and intensely mortified,
while something told him that his mother was not altogether
wrong in her estimation of the girl, whose picture
did resemble more a second-rate actress tricked out in her
flashy finery than a pure, modest young girl; but he answered
his mother’s question, and said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“She lives in Holburton, New York, and her name is
Josephine Fleming. I boarded for three weeks last
summer with her mother, Widow Roxie Fleming, as the
people call her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He spit the last out a little defiantly, feeling resolved
that his mother should know all he knew about the
Flemings, be it good or bad, but he was not prepared for
the next remark.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Roxie? Roxie Fleming? Is she a second wife,
and is there a step daughter much older than Josephine?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes; but how did you know it, and where have you
seen them?” Everard asked, eagerly, his anger giving
way to his nervous dread of some development worse
even than the dollar jewelry, which had hurt him
cruelly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Years ago, when I was a young girl, we had in our
family a cook, Roxie Burrows by name, competent, tidy,
and faithful in the discharge of her duties, but crafty,
designing and ambitious. Our butcher was a Mr. Fleming,
a native of Ireland, and a very respectable man,
whose little daughter used sometimes to bring us the
steak for breakfast in the morning, and through whom
Roxie captured the father, after the mother died. She
was so sorry for the child, and mended her frocks, and
made much of her till the father was won, when, it was
said, the tables were turned, and little Agnes mended the
frocks and darned the socks, while Roxie played the
lady. I remember hearing of the birth of a daughter,
but I was married about that time, and knew no more of
the Flemings until a few years later, when I was visiting
in Boston, and mother told me that he was dead, and
Roxie had gone with the children to some place West.
I am sure it must be the same woman with whom you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>boarded. Has she sandy hair and light gray eyes, with
long yellow lashes?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, she has; it is the same,” Everard replied, with
a feeling like death in his heart as he thought how impossible
it was now to tell his mother that Josephine
was his wife.</p>

<p class='c011'>How impossible it was that she would ever be reconciled
to the daughter of her cook and butcher, who added
to her other faults the enormity of wearing dollar jewelry!
And I think that last really hurt Everard the
most. On such points he was very fastidious and particular,
and more than once had himself thought Josey’s
dress too flashy, but the glamour of love was over all,
and a glance of her blue eyes, or touch of her white
hands always set him right again and brought him back
to his allegiance. But the hands and the eyes were not
there now to stand between him and what his mother
had said, and he felt like crying out bitterly as he took
back his photograph and listened a few moments longer,
while his mother talked lovingly and kindly, telling him
he must forgive her if she had seemed harsh, that it was
for his good, as he would one day see. He would forget
this boyish fancy in time and come to wonder at his infatuation.
Forget it! with those words ever in his
ears, “I pronounce you man and wife.” He could <em>not</em>
forget, and it was not quite sure that he would do so if
he could. Josey’s face and Josey’s wiles had a power
over him yet to keep him comparatively loyal. He had
loved her with all the intensity of a boy’s first fervent
passion, which never stopped to criticise her manner, or
language, or style of dress, though, now that his eyes
were opened a little, it occurred to him that there might
be something flashy in her appearance, and something
told him that the massive chain and cross, so conspicuous
on Josephine’s bosom, came from that store in Pittsfield,
where everything was a dollar, from an immense picture
down to a set of spoons. And his mother had detected
it, by what subtle intuition he could not guess;
and had traced her origin back to a butcher and a
cook! Well, what then? Was Josey the worse for
that? Was it not America’s boast that the children of
butchers, and bakers, and candlestick-makers should
stand in the high places and give rule? Certainly it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>was, and his mother herself had said it was neither birth
nor blood which made the lady. It was a nobleness from
within asserting itself without, and stamping its impress
upon its possessor. And had Josephine this inborn refinement
and nobility, or had she not? That was the
point which troubled the young man as he went out from
his mother’s presence, and sought a little arbor in a retired
part of the grounds where he would be free to think
it out. With his head, which was aching terribly, bowed
upon his hands, he went over all the past as connected
with Josephine, detecting here and there many a word
and act which, alas, went far toward proving that his
mother’s estimate of her was not very wrong. But how
did his mother divine it? Had women some secret
method of reading each other unknown to the other sex.
Could Beatrice read her, too, from that photograph, and
what would Bee’s verdict be? He wished he knew;
wished he could show it to her incidentally as the photograph
of a mere acquaintance. And while he was thus
thinking he heard in the distance Bee’s voice, and lifting
up his head he saw her coming down the long walk gayly
and airily, in her pretty white muslin dress, with a bit of
pink coral in her ears and in the lace bow at her throat.
One could see that she was a saucy, fun-loving, frolicsome
girl, with opinions of her own, which sometimes
startled the staid ones who walked year by year in the
same rut, but she was every whit a lady, and looked it,
too, as she came rapidly toward Everard, who found
himself studying and criticising her as he had never
criticised a woman before. She was not like Josephine,
though wherein the difference consisted he could not tell.
He only knew that the load at his heart was heavier than
ever, and that he almost felt that in some way he was
aggrieved by this young girl, who, when she saw him,
hastened her steps and was soon at his side.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, here you are,” she said, “Rossie told me I
should find you in the garden. I came to inquire after
that broken head, for which I feel responsible. Why,
Ned,” she continued, calling him by the old familiar
name of his boyhood, “how white you are! I am afraid
it was more serious than I supposed;” and she looked
anxiously into his pale, worn face.</p>

<p class='c011'>His head was aching terribly, but he would not acknowledge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>it. He only said he was a little tired, that
the cut on his forehead was nothing, and would soon be
well; then, making Beatrice sit down beside him, he began
to ask her numberless questions about the people of
Rothsay, especially the young ladies. Where was Sylvia
Blackmer, and where was Annie Doane, and, by the way,
where was Allie Beadle, that pretty little blonde, with
the great blue eyes, who used to sing in the choir.</p>

<p class='c011'>“By Jove, she was pretty,” he said, “except that her
hair was a little too yellow. She looks so much like a
girl east that some of the college boys rave about, only
this girl, Miss Fleming, is the prettier of the two. I
shouldn’t wonder if I had her photograph somewhere.
She had a lot taken and gave me one. Yes, here it is,”
he continued, after a feint of rummaging his pocket-book.
“What do you think of her?” he asked, passing
the picture to Beatrice, and feeling himself a monster of
duplicity and deception.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bee took the card, and looking at it a moment, said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, she is very pretty; but you don’t want anything
to do with that girl. She is not like you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was the old story repeated, and Everard felt nettled
and annoyed, but managed not to show it, as he
replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who said I did want anything to do with her? But
honestly, though, what do you see in her to dislike?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nothing to dislike,” Bee said, “I do not fancy her
make-up, that’s all. She looks as if she would wear cotton
lace!” and having said what in her estimation was
the worst thing she could say of a woman, Beatrice
handed him back the picture, which he put up silently,
feeling that he could not tell Beatrice of Josey.</p>

<p class='c011'>He could not tell anybody unless it was Rossie, and
he did not believe he cared to do that now, though he
would like to show her the picture and hear what she
had to say. Would she see dollar jewelry and cotton
lace in the face he thought so divine? He meant to try
her, and after Beatrice was gone he strolled off to a
shaded part of the grounds, where he came upon Rossie
watering a bed of fuchsias. She was not sylph-like and
graceful, or clad in airy muslin, like Beatrice. She was
unformed and angular, and her dress was a dark chintz,
short enough to show her slender ankles, which he had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>once teasingly called pipe-stems, and her thick boots,
which were much too large, for she would not have her
feet pinched, and always wore shoes a size and a-half too
big. A clean white apron, ruffled and fluted, and a white
sun-bonnet, completed her costume. Josephine would
have called her “homely,” if she had noticed her at all,
and some such idea was in Everard’s mind as he approached
her; but when, at the sound of his footsteps,
she turned and flashed upon him from beneath the cape bonnet
those great, brilliant eyes, he changed his mind,
and thought: “Won’t those eyes do mischief yet, when
Rossie gets a little older.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She was glad to see him, and stopped watering her
flowers while she inquired after his head, and if Miss
Belknap found him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, she did,” he said, adding, as he sat down in a
rustic chair: “Bee is handsome and no mistake.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s so,” Rossie replied, promptly, for Bee Belknap’s
beauty was her hobby. “She is the handsomest
girl I ever saw. Don’t you think so?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Here was his opportunity, and he hastened to seize it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, no,” he said, “not the very handsomest I
ever saw. I have a photograph of a girl I think prettier.
Here she is.” And he passed Josephine’s picture toward
Rossie, who set down her watering-pot, and wiping her
soiled hands, took it as carefully as if it had been the
picture of a goddess.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Mr. Everard!” she cried, “she is beautiful;
more so than Miss Beatrice, I do believe. Such dreamy
eyes, which look at you so kind of—kind of coaxingly,
somehow; and such lovely hair! Who is she, Mr.
Everard?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, she’s one of the girls,” Everard answered, laughingly,
and experiencing a sudden revulsion of feeling in
Josey’s favor at Rossie’s opinion of her.</p>

<p class='c011'>Here was one who could give an unprejudiced opinion;
here was a champion for Josey; and in his delight,
Everard thought how, with his first spare money, he
would buy Rossie a gold ring, as a reward of merit for
what she had said of Josey. Her next remarks, however,
dampened his ardor a little.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She’s very rich, isn’t she?” Rossie asked; and he
replied:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>“No, not rich at all. Why do you think that?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Because she has such a big chain and cross, and
such heavy bracelets and ear-rings, and is dressed more
than Miss Belknap dresses at a grand party,” Rossie
said: and Everard answered her quickly:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Rossie, you are a little thing, not much bigger than
my thumb, but you have more sense than many older
girls. Tell me, then, if you know, is it bad taste to be
overdressed in a picture, and is it a crime, a sin, to wear
bogus jewelry?”</p>

<p class='c011'>She did not at all know at what he was aiming, and,
pleased with the compliment to her wisdom, answered,
with great gravity:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not a crime to wear flash jewelry,—no. I wore a
brass ring once till it blacked my finger. I wore a glass
breast-pin, too, which cost me twenty-five cents, till your
mother said it was foolish, and not like a lady. But I
do not think it’s a crime; it’s only <em>second-classy</em>. A
great many do it, and I shouldn’t wonder a bit if,”—here
the little lady looked very wise, and lifted her forefinger
by way of emphasis—“I shouldn’t wonder a bit if
this chain and cross were both shams, for now that I
look at her more closely, she looks like a sham, too.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Rosamond’s prospect for a ring was gone forever,
and Everard’s voice trembled as he took back his picture,
and said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you, Rossie, for telling me what you thought.
Maybe she is a sham. Most things are in this world, I
find.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then he walked rapidly away, while Rossie stood
looking after him and wondering if he was angry with
her, and who the young girl was, and if he really liked
her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I hope not,” she thought, “for though she is very
handsome, there is something about her which does not
seem like Mr. Everard and Miss Beatrice. They ought
to go together; they must; it is so suitable;” and
having settled the future of Beatrice and Everard to her
own satisfaction, the little girl resumed her work among
the flowers, and did not see Everard again until suppertime,
when he looked so pale and tired that even his
father noticed it and asked if he were sick.</p>

<p class='c011'>The cut over his eye was paining him, he said, and if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>they would excuse him he would retire to his room early,
and should probably be all right on the morrow. The
night was hot and sultry, and even the light breeze from
the river seemed oppressive and laden with thunder, and
for hours Everard lay awake thinking of the future,
which stretched before him so drearily with that burden
on his mind. How he wished that it might prove a
dream, from which he should awake to find himself free
once more,—free to marry Josephine if he chose, and he
presumed he should, but not till his college days were
over, and he could take her openly and publicly as a
true man takes the woman he loves and honors. How
he hated to be a sneak and a coward, and he called himself
by these names many times, and loathed himself for
the undefinable something creeping over him, and which
made him shrink even from Josephine herself as Josephine.
He said he did not care a picayune for the
butcher and the cook, and he did not care for the
dollar jewelry and cotton lace, though he would rather
his mother and Bee had not used the opprobrious
terms, but he did care for the <em>sham</em> of which his
mother had spoken, and which even Rossie had detected.
Was Josey a sham, and if so, what was his
life with her to be? Alas for Everard! he was only
just entering the cloud which was to overshadow him
for so many wretched years. At last he fell into a
troubled sleep, from which he was aroused by the noise
of the storm of rain which had swept down the river and
was beating against the house, but above the storm there
was another sound, Rossie calling to him in tones of
affright, and bidding him hasten to his mother, who was
dying.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of all which followed next Everard retained in after
life but a vague consciousness. There was a confused
dressing in the dark, a hurrying to his mother, whose
white face turned so eagerly toward him, and whose
pallid lips were pressed upon his brow as they prayed
God to keep him from evil, and bring him at last to the
world she was going to. There were words of love and
tender parting to the stricken husband and heart-broken
Rossie, who had been to her like a daughter, and whom
she committed to the care of both Everard and his
father, as a precious legacy left in their charge. Then,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>drawing Everard close to her, she whispered so low that
no one else could hear:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Forgive me if I seemed harsh in what I said of
Josephine. I only meant it for your good. I may have
been mistaken; I hope I was. I hope she is good, and
true, and womanly, and if she is, and you love her, her
birth is of no consequence, none whatever. God bless
you, my child, and her, too!”</p>

<p class='c011'>She never spoke again, and when the early summer
morning looked into the room, there was only a still,
motionless figure on the bed, with pale hands folded
upon the bosom, and the pillow strewn with flowers,
which Rosamond had put there. Rosamond thought of
everything; first of the dead, then of the stern judge,
who broke down entirely by the side of his lost Mary,
and then of Everard, who seemed like one stunned by a
heavy blow. With the constantly increasing pain in his
head, blinding him even more than the tears he shed, he
wrote to Josephine:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Josey, you will be sorry for me when I tell you
mother is dead. She died this morning at three o’clock,
and I am heart-broken. She was all the world to me.
What shall I do without my mother?”</p>

<p class='c011'>He posted the letter himself, and then kept his room,
and for the most part his bed, until the day of the funeral,
when, hardly knowing what he was doing, or realizing
what was passing around him, he stood by his
mother’s grave, saw the coffin lowered into it, heard the
earth rattling down upon it, and had a strange sensation
of wonder as to whom they were burying, and who he
was himself. That puzzled him the most, except, indeed,
the question as to where the son was, the young
man from Amherst College, who drove such fast horses,
and smoked so many cigars, and sometimes bet at cards.
“He ought to be here seeing to this,” he thought; and
then, as a twinge of pain shot through his temple, he
moaned faintly, and went back to the carriage, in which
he was driven rapidly home.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a letter from Josephine in his room, which
had come while he was at his mother’s grave. He recognized
the handwriting at once, and with a feeling as if
something were clutching his throat and impeding his
breath, he took it up, and opening it, read his first letter
from his wife.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/di_056.jpg' width='100' alt=''>
</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
Immediately after Everard’s departure she
wrote to the postmaster at Clarence, making
inquiries for Doctor Matthewson, and in due
time received an answer addressed to the
fictitious name which she had given. There
had been a clergyman in town by that name, the postmaster
wrote, but he had been dismissed for various misdemeanors.
However, a marriage performed by him,
with the knowledge and consent of the parties, would
undoubtedly be binding on such parties. Latterly he
had taken to the study of medicine, and assumed the title
of “Doctor.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There could be no mistake, and the harrowing doubt
which had so weighed on Josephine’s spirits gave way
as she read this answer to her letter. She was Mrs.
James Everard Forrest, and she wrote the name many
times on slips of paper which she tore up and threw
upon the floor. Then, summoning Agnes from the
kitchen, she bade her arrange her hair, for there was a
concert in the Hall that night, and she was going. Always
meek and submissive, Agnes obeyed, and brushed
and curled the beautiful golden hair, and helped array
her sister in the pretty blue muslin, and clasped about
her neck and arms the heavy bracelets and chain which
had been so criticised and condemned at the Forrest
House. They were not quite as bright now as when the
young lady first bought them in Pittsfield. Their luster
was somewhat tarnished, and Josephine knew it, and
felt a qualm of disgust every time she looked at them.
She knew the difference between the real and the sham
quite as well as Beatrice herself, and by and by, when
she was established in her rightful position as Mrs. Everard
Forrest, she meant to indulge to the full her fondness
for dress, and make amends for the straits to which she
had all her life been subjected.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She would make old Forrest’s money fly, only let
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>her have a chance,” she said to Agnes, to whom she was
repeating the contents of the letter just received from
Clarence.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then it’s true, and you are his wife?” Agnes said,
her voice indicative of anything but pleasure.</p>

<p class='c011'>This Josephine was quick to detect, and she answered,
sharply:</p>

<p class='c011'>“His wife? yes. Have you any objection? One
would suppose by your manner that you were sorry for
Everard.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And so I am,” Agnes answered, boldly. “I don’t
believe he knew what he was doing. It’s a pity for him,
he is so young, and we so different.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“So different, Agnes? I wish you wouldn’t forever
harp on that string. As if I were not quite as good as a
Forrest or any other aristocrat. Can’t you ever forget
your Irish blood? It does not follow because the poor
people in Ireland and England lie down and let the
nobility walk over them, that we do it in America, where
it does sometimes happen that the daughter of a butcher
and a cook may marry into a family above her level.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I know all that,” Agnes said. “Praised be
Heaven for America, where everybody who has it in him
can rise if he will; and yet, there’s a difference here,
just as much and more, I sometimes think, for to be somebody
you must have it in you. I can’t explain, but I
know what I mean, and so do you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I do,” Josephine replied, angrily. “You mean
that I have not the requisite qualifications to make me
acceptable at the Forrest House; that my fine lady from
Boston would be greatly shocked to know that the mother
of her daughter-in-law once cooked her dinner and
washed her clothes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, not for that,—not for birth or poverty,” Agnes
said, eagerly, “but because you are,—you are——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, what?” Josephine demanded, impatiently,
and Agnes replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are what you are.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And pray what am I?” Josephine retorted. “I <em>was</em>
Miss Josephine Fleming, daughter of Mrs. Roxie Fleming,
who used to work for the Bigelows of Boston till
she married an Irish butcher, who was shabby enough to
die and leave her to shift for herself, which she did by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>taking boarders. That’s what I <em>was</em>. <em>Now</em>, I am Mrs.
James Everard Forrest, with a long line of blue-blooded
Southern ancestry, to say nothing of the bluer Bigelows
of Boston. That’s who I am; so please button my boots
and bring me my shawl and fan; it’s high time I was
off.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Agnes obeyed, and buttoned the boots, and put a bit
of blacking on the toe where the leather was turning
red, and brought the fleecy shawl and wrapped it carefully
around her sister, who looked exceedingly graceful
and pretty, and bore herself like a princess as she entered
the Hall and took one of the most conspicuous seats.
How she wished the people could know the honor to
which she had come; and when, to the question as to
who she was, asked by a stranger behind her, she heard
the reply, “Oh, that’s Joe Fleming; her mother keeps
boarders,” she longed to shriek out her new name, and
announce herself as Mrs. James Everard Forrest. But
it was policy to keep silent, and she was content to bide
her time, and anticipate what she would do in the future
when her marriage was announced. Of Everard himself
she thought a great deal, but she thought more of his
position and wealth than she did of him. And yet she
was very anxious to hear from him, and when his letter
came she tore it open eagerly, while a bright flush colored
her cheek when she saw the words, “My dear little
wife,” and her heart was very light as she read the brief
letter,—so light, in fact, that it felt no throb of pity for
the sick and dying mother. Josey had heard from her
mother of the aristocratic Miss Bigelow, at whose
grand wedding governors and senators had been present,
and she shrank from this high-born woman, who might
weigh her in the balance and find her sadly wanting.
So she felt no sympathy with Everard’s touching inquiry,
“What shall I do without my mother?” He
would do very well indeed, she thought, and as for herself,
she would rather reign alone at Forrest House than
share her kingdom with another. How she chafed and
fretted that she could not begin her triumph at once,
but must wait two years, at least, and be known as Josephine
Fleming, who held her position in Holburton
only with her pretty face and determined will. But
there was no help for it, and, for the present, she must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>be content with the knowledge that Everard was hers,
and that by and by his money would be hers also. To
do her justice, however, she was just now a good deal in
love with her young husband, and thought of him almost
as often as of his money, though that was a very weighty
consideration, and when her mother suggested that there
was no reason why she should not, to a certain degree,
be supported by her husband, even if she did not take
his name, she indorsed the suggestion heartily, and the
letter she wrote to Everard, in reply to his, contained a
request for money.</p>

<p class='c011'>The letter was as follows:</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Holburton</span>, July—.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Everard</span>:—I was so glad to get your letter,
and oh, my darling, how sorry I am to hear of your dear
mother’s dangerous illness! I trust it is not as bad as
you feared, and hope she may recover. I know I should
love her, and I mean to try to be what I think she would
wish your wife to be. I am anxious to know if you told
her, and what she said.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I have written to Clarence, as Dr. Matthewson bade
me do, and find that he really was a clergyman; so there
can be no mistake about the marriage, and if you do not
regret it I certainly do not, only it is kind of forlorn to
know you have a husband and still live apart from him,
and be denied the privilege of his name. It is for the best,
however, and I am content to wait your pleasure. And,
now, my dear husband, don’t think meanly of me, will you,
and accuse me of being mercenary. You would not if
you knew the straits we are driven to in order to meet
our expenses. Now that I am your wife I wish to take
lessons in music and French, so as to fit myself for the
position I hope one day to fill in your family. You must
not be ashamed of me, and you shall not, if I only have
the means with which to improve my mind. If you can
manage to send me fifty dollars I shall make the best
possible use of it. You do not know how I hate to ask
you so soon, but I feel that I must in order to carry out
my plans for improvement.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And now, my darling husband, I put both my arms
around your neck and kiss you many, many times, and

<p class='c011'>“I haven’t told more than three falsehoods,” Josey
said to herself, as she read the letter over. “I said I
hoped his mother would recover, and that I knew I should
love her, and that I wanted the money to pay for music
and French, when, in fact, I want more a silk dress in
two shades of brown. And he will send it, too. He’ll
manage to get it from his father or mother, and I may
as well drop in at Burt’s and look at the silk this afternoon,
on my way to post this letter.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She did drop in at Burt’s and looked at the silk, and
saw another piece, more desirable every way, and fifty
cents more a yard. And from looking she grew to coveting,
and was sorry that she had not asked for seventy-five
instead of fifty dollars, as the one would be as likely
to be forthcoming as the other. Once she thought to
open her letter and add a P. S. to it, but finally decided
to wait and write again for the extra twenty-five. The
merchant would reserve the silk for her a week or more,
he said, and picturing to herself how she should look in
the two shades of brown, Josey tripped off to the post-office,
where she deposited the letter, which Everard
found upon his table on his return from his mother’s
grave. It was the silk which in Josey’s mind was the
most desirable, but the music and the French must be had
as well, and so she called upon a Mrs. Herring, who gave
music lessons in the town, and proposed that she should
have two lessons a week, with the use of piano, and that
as compensation the lady’s washing, and that of her little
girl, should be done by sister Agnes, who was represented
as the instigator of the plan. As the arrangement
was better for the lady than for Josey, the bargain was
closed at once, and Mrs. J. E. Forrest took her first lesson
that very afternoon, showing such an aptitude and eagerness
to learn that her teacher assured her of quick and
brilliant success as a performer. The French was managed
in much the same way, and paid for in plain sewing,
which Josey, who was handy and neat with her needle,
undertook herself, instead of putting it upon her mother
or poor Agnes, who, on the Monday following, saw, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>dismay, the basket piled high with extra linen, which she
was to wash and iron. There was a weary sigh from the
heavily-burdened woman, and then she took up this added
task without a single protest, and scrubbed, and toiled,
and sweat, that Josey might have the accomplishments
which were to fit her to be mistress of the Forrest
House.</p>

<p class='c011'>Every day Josey passed the shop window at Burt’s,
and stopped to admire the silk, and at last fell into the
trap laid for her by the scheming merchant, who told
her that three other ladies had been looking at it with a
view to purchase, and she’d better decide to take it at
once if she really wanted it; so she took it, and wrote to
Everard that night, asking why he did not send the fifty
dollars, and asking him to increase it with twenty-five
more.</p>

He was so giddy, and sick, and faint, when he
returned to the house from his mother’s
grave, that he had scarcely strength to reach
his room, where the first object which caught
his eye was Josephine’s letter upon the table.
Very eagerly he caught it up, and breaking the seal,
began to read it, his pulse quickening and his heart beating
rapidly as he thought, “She would be so sorry for
me if she knew.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He was so heart-sore and wretched in his bereavement,
and he wanted the sympathy of some one,—wanted to
be petted, as his mother had always petted him in all
his griefs, and as she would never pet him again. She
was dead, and his heart went out with a great yearning
after his young wife, as the proper person to comfort
and soothe him now. Had she been there he would
have declared her his in the face of all the world, and
laying his aching head in her lap would have sobbed
out his sorrow. But she was far away, and he was reading
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>her letter, which did not give him much satisfaction
from the very first. There was an eagerness to assure
him that the marriage was valid, and he was glad,
of course, that it was so, and could not blame her for
chafing against the secrecy which they must for a time
maintain; but what was this request for fifty dollars,—this
hint that she had a right to ask support from him?
In all his dread of the evils involved in a secret marriage
he had never dreamed that she would ask him so soon for
fifty dollars, when he had not five in the world, and but
for Rosamond’s generous forethought in sending him
the ten he would have been obliged to borrow to get
home. Fifty dollars! It seemed to the young man like
a fabulous sum, which he could never procure. For how
was he to do it? He had told his father distinctly that
he was free from debt, that he did not owe a dollar,
and if he should go to him now with a request for fifty
dollars what would he say? It made Everard shiver
just to think of confronting his stern father with that
demand. The thing was impossible. “I can’t do it,”
he said; and then, in his despair, it occurred to him that
Josey had no right to make this demand upon him so
soon; she might have known he could only meet it by
asking his father, which was sure to bring a fearful storm
about his head. It was not modest, it was not nice in
her, it was not womanly; Bee would never have done it,
Rossie would never have done it; but they were different—and
there came back to him the remembrance of what
his mother had said, and with it a great horror lest Josephine
might really lack that innate refinement which
marks a true lady. But he would not be disloyal to her
even in thought; she was his wife, and she had a right to
look to him for support when she could have nothing else.
She could not take his name, she could not have his
society, and he was a brute to feel annoyed because she
asked him for money with which to fit herself for his
wife. “She is to be commended for it,” he thought.
“I wish her to be accomplished when I present her to
Bee, who is such a splendid performer, and jabbers
French like a native. Oh, if I had the money,” he continued,
feeling as by a revelation that Josephine would
never cease her importunings until she had what she
wanted.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>But how should he get it? Could he work at something
and earn it, or could he sell his watch, his mother’s
gift when he was eighteen?</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, not that; I can’t part with that,” he groaned;
and then he remembered his best suit of clothes, which
had cost nearly a hundred dollars, and a great many
hard words from his father. He could sell these in Cincinnati;
he had just money enough to go there and
back, and he would do it the next day, and make some
excuse for taking a valise, and no one need be the wiser.
That was the very best thing he could do, and comforted
with this decision he crept shivering to bed just as the
clock was striking the hour of eleven.</p>

<p class='c011'>Breakfast waited a long time for him the next morning,
and when she saw how impatient the judge was
growing, Rosamond went to his door and knocked
loudly upon it, but received no answer, except a faint
sound like a moan of pain, which frightened her, and
sent her at once to the judge, who went himself to his
son’s room. Everard was not asleep, nor did he look as
if he had ever slept, with his blood-shot, wide-open eyes
rolling restlessly in his head, which moved from side to
side as if in great distress. He did not know his father;
he did not know anybody; and said that he was not
sick, when the doctor came, and he would not be blistered
and he wouldn’t be bled; he must get up and have his
clothes,—his best ones,—and he made Rossie bring them
to him and fold them up and put them in his satchel,
which he kept upon his bed all during the two weeks
when he lay raving with delirium and burning with
fever induced by the cut on his head, and aggravated by
the bleeding and blistering which he had without stint.
Rossie was the nurse who staid constantly with him, and
who alone could quiet him when he was determined to
get up and sell his clothes. This was the burden of his
talk.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I must sell them and get the money,” he would say,—but,
with a singular kind of cunning common to crazy
people, he never said money before his father. It was
only to Rosamond that he talked of that, and once, when
she sat alone with him, he said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t let the governor know, for your life.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, I won’t; you can trust me,” she replied; then,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>while she bathed his throbbing head, she asked: “Why
do you want the money, Mr. Everard? What will you
do with it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Send it to <em>Joe</em>,” he said. “Do you know Joe?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Rossie didn’t know Joe, and she innocently asked:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who is he?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who is he?” Everard repeated: “ha, ha! that’s a
good joke. <em>He</em>,—Joe would enjoy that; <em>he</em> is a splendid
fellow, I tell you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And you owe him?” Rossie asked, her heart sinking
like lead at his prompt reply.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, that’s it; you’ve hit the nail. I owe him and
I must pay, and that’s why I sell my clothes. I owe him
money,—<em>him</em>,—that’s capital.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He had told her that he had no debts and she believed
him, and had been so glad, and thought he had broken
from his old associates and habits, and was trying to do
better. And it was not so at all; he had not broken
off; he still had dealings with a mysterious Joe, whoever
he might be. Some great hulking fellow, no doubt,
who drank, and raced, and gambled, and had led Everard
astray. Rossie’s heart was very sad and her voice
full of sorrow as she asked next:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Was it gambling? Was it at play that you incurred
this debt?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, by George, you’ve hit it again!” he exclaimed,
catching at the word <em>play</em>. “It was a play, and for fun
I thought at first, but it proved to be the real thing,—a
lark,—a sell,—a trap. By Jove, I b’lieve it was a trap,
and they meant me to fall into it; I do, upon my word,
and I fell, and now Joe must have fifty dollars from
me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Fifty dollars!” and Rossie gasped at the enormous
sum.</p>

<p class='c011'>Where would he get it? Where could he get it?
Not from his father, that was certain, and not from her,
for her quarterly interest on her two thousand dollars
was not due in weeks, and even if it were, it was not
fifty dollars. Perhaps Miss Belknap would loan it if she
were to ask her, and assume the payment herself. But
in that case she must give the reason, and she would not
for the world compromise Everard by so much as a
breath of censure. Bee must think well of him at all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>costs, for Rossie’s heart was quite as much set on Beatrice’s
being the mistress of Forrest House, some day, as
the mother’s had been. She could not borrow of Miss
Belknap, but,—Rossie started from her chair as quickly
as if she had been struck, while her hands involuntarily
clutched her luxuriant hair, rippling in heavy masses
down her back. She <em>could</em> do that for Mr. Everard, but
her face was white to her lips, which quivered a little as
she resumed her seat, and said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is Joe’s other name? Joe what?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Everard looked at her cunningly a moment, and then
replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Guess!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I can’t,” she replied, “I have nothing to start
from; nothing to guide me; I might guess all day, and
not get it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Suppose you start with some kind of fruit, say
<em>pears</em>. What varieties have we in our garden?” he said;
and Rossie answered:</p>

<p class='c011'>“There are the Seckels. Is it Joe Seckels?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Joe Bartlett?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Joe Bell?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Joe Vergelieu?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Joe Sheldon?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There’s the Louise Bonne de Jersey. It can’t be
Joe Bonne de Jersey.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, stupid.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, Flemish Beauty? It can’t be that.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How do you know? Joe is a beauty, and a Flemish
one, if you change the <em>sh</em> into <em>ng</em>. No, try ’em again.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Joe Fleming?” Rossie asked, and with an insane
chuckle Everard replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“<em>You bet!</em> Rossie, you are a brick! You are a
trump! You’ve hit it exactly,—<em>Joe Fleming</em>.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Rossie had in her pocket a pencil, and on a bit of
newspaper wrote the name rapidly, and then asked:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Does he live in Amherst?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>“In Ellicottville?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, then, in Holburton, where you were last
summer. Didn’t you board with a Fleming?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are right again. He lives in Holburton,”
Everard replied, laughing immoderately at the idea of
<em>he</em> as applied to Josephine.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus far he had answered all Rossie’s questions correctly,
but when she said, “Tell me, please, his right
name. Is it Joel, or Joseph, or what?” the old look of
cunning leaped into his eyes, and he answered her:</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, you don’t. Joe is enough for you to know.
Besides, why are you questioning me so closely? What
are you going to do?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m going to try and get you out of your trouble,”
Rossie said, and starting up in bed, Everard exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Get me out of the scrape! Oh, Rossie, if you only
would,—if you only could!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I can, I will!” Rossie said, emphatically, and he
continued:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Out of every single bit of it?—the whole thing, so
I’ll be free again?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” Rossie answered at random; “I think, I am
sure, I will. But you must keep very quiet and not get
excited, or talk. Try to sleep, and I’ll fix it for you
beautifully.”</p>

<p class='c011'>How hopeful she was, and the delirious man believed
and trusted in her, and promised to sleep while she was
gone to fix it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But it may take a few days, you know,” she said,
“so you must be patient, and wait.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He acceded to everything, and closed his eyes as she
left the room and repaired to her own, where she went
straight to the glass, and letting out her heavy braids of
hair, suffered it to fall over her shoulders like a vail.
Then Rossie studied herself, and saw a thin face, with
great, wide-open, black eyes, which would look larger,
more wide-open still, with all that hair gone. What a
fright she would be without her hair, which was beautiful.
Bee Belknap had said so, others had said so, and,
if she was not mistaken, Everard had said so, too, and
for his sake she’d like to keep it, though for his sake she
was deciding to part with it. Maybe he did not think
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>it pretty, after all. She wished she knew; and, yielding
to a sudden impulse, she went back to his room with all
her shining tresses about her, and so astonished him
that he called out:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Halloo, Lady Godiva! Are you going to ride
through the town, clothed with modesty?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Rossie was not well versed in Tennyson, and knew
nothing of Lady Godiva, but she said to him:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mr. Everard, do you think my hair pretty?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nothing extra,” was his reply. “I’ve seen hair
handsomer than that. Don’t be vain, Rossie. You will
never be a beauty, hair or no hair.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Her pride was hurt a little, but her mind was made
up, and retiring to her room and fastening herself in,
she sat down to write to <em>Joe Fleming</em>.</p>

Reason said to her, “Perhaps there is no such
person as Joe Fleming. Mr. Everard is
crazy and does not know what he is saying;”
but to this Rossie replied, “That may be, but
even then there can be no harm in writing.
The letter will go to the dead-letter office and no one
be the wiser, and if there is a Joe, he deserves to have a
piece of my mind. I shall write any way.” And she
did write, and this is a copy of the letter:</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c012'>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Fleming</span>—<em>Sir</em>: I take the liberty of writing
to you, because I think you ought to know how sick Mr.
Everard Forrest is, and how much he is troubled about
the money he owes you. He was thrown from a carriage
and hurt, more than ten days ago, and his mother
died that same night, and you wrote for money, and
everything together made him very sick and out of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>head, and that is the way I came to know about you and
that gambling debt of his. I am Rosamond Hastings, a
little girl who lives in the family, and Mr. Everard is
like a brother to me, and I take care of him, and heard
him talk of <em>Joe</em> and money which he had to pay, and he
wanted to sell his clothes to raise it, and I found out
from him that your name was Fleming, and that he
owed you fifty dollars which must be paid at once.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I suppose men would call it a debt of <em>honor</em>, but,
Mr. Fleming, do you think it right to gamble and entice
young men like Mr. Everard to play? I think it is very
wicked, and dishonorable, and disreputable, and that you
ought not to expect him to pay. Why, he <em>cannot</em>, for
he has no money of his own, and his father would not
give it to him for that, and would be so very angry that
whatever comes <em>he</em> must never know it,—never.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now, will you give up the debt and not bother him
any more? If you will, please write to him and say so.
If you will not, write to me, and I shall try what I can
do, for Mr. Everard must not be troubled with it.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hoping you will excuse me, and that you will reform
and be a better man, I am,</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c012'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“P. S.—You are not to suppose that Mr. Everard
knows I am writing, for he does not; nor are you to
think that he has spoken ill of you in his delirium. On
the contrary, I imagine that he likes you very much indeed,
and so I am led to hope that there is much good
in you, and that you will not only release him, but quit
gambling yourself.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She sealed the letter, and directing it to “<span class='sc'>Mr. Joe
Fleming, Esq.</span>, Holburton, Mass.,” posted it herself,
and then anxiously waited the answer.</p>

<p class='c011'>Three days later, and the clerk in the post-office at
Holburton said, in reply to Josey’s inquiry for letters:</p>

<p class='c011'>“There’s one here for Mr. Joe Fleming; that can’t
be you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Let me see it,” Josey said; and when she saw that
it was from Rothsay, Ohio, she continued: “It is for
me, and it is done for a joke. I will take it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, hurrying home, she broke the seal and read
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>the curious letter, amid screams of convulsive laughter,
which brought both her mother and Agnes to her
side.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Look here; just listen, will you?” she said, “somebody
thinks I’m a man, and a gambler, and everything
bad.” And she read the letter aloud, while the tears
ran down her face, and she grew almost hysterical with
her glee. “Did you ever know a richer joke? What
a stupid thing that girl must be,” she said.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Agnes made no reply, and went quietly back to
her work, while Josephine read the letter a third time,
feeling a little sorry for and a little anxious about Everard.
Rossie’s postscript that he seemed to like her very
much touched her and brought something like moisture
to her eyes; but she never for a moment thought of giving
up the <em>debt</em>. She must have the fifty dollars, for
the brown silk was nearly finished, and the merchant expected
his money, so she wrote to Rossie as follows:</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c012'>

<p class='c013'>“Your letter is received, and though I am very sorry
for Mr. Forrest’s illness, and agree with you that it is
wrong to gamble, I must still insist upon the money, as
I am in great want of it, and Mr. Forrest will tell you
that my claim is a just one. I may as well add that
twenty-five dollars more are due me, which I shall be
glad to have you send. I have written Mr. Forrest
about it, but presume he has not been able to attend to it.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Josephine’s handwriting was large and plain, and she
took great pains to make it still plainer and more masculine,
and Rossie, when she received the letter, had no
suspicion that it was not written by a man. Hastily
breaking the seal, she read, with sinking heart, that the
money must be paid, and, worse than all, that it was
seventy-five instead of fifty dollars, as she had supposed.
And she must raise it, and save Mr. Everard from all
further trouble and anxiety. He was better now, and
very quiet, and had allowed her to remove the satchel
of clothes from his bed. Occasionally he spoke to her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>of Joe, and asked if she was sure she could help him out
of the scrape.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, sure,” was always the reply of the brave little
girl; and she must keep her word at the sacrifice
of what she held most dear, her abundant and beautiful
hair.</p>

<p class='c011'>Rossie’s mind was made up, and, after lunch was over,
she started for Elm Park, where Miss Belknap lived.
Bee was at home, and glad to see her little friend. She
was very fond of Rossie, whose quaint, old-fashioned
ways amused and rested her; and she took her at once
to the pretty blue chamber, which Rossie admired so
much, and which seemed so in keeping with its lovely
mistress. All Bee’s tastes were of the most luxurious
kind, and, as she had no lack of means, she gratified
them to the full. The fever, which had deprived her of
her hair, had hurt her pride sorely; for the wig which
she was wearing until her own hair grew again was not
a success, and she chafed against it, and hated herself
every time she looked in the glass; and when Rosamond,
who could not wait lest her courage should fail her, said,
“Miss Beatrice, are you in earnest about my hair? Will
you buy it now?” she answered,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Buy it? Yes, in a moment.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And give me seventy-five dollars?” Rossie faltered,
ashamed of herself for asking this enormous sum.</p>

<p class='c011'>But it did not at all appall Miss Belknap. Seventy-five
dollars was nothing if she wished for anything, and
she did want Rossie’s hair. It was just the color and
texture of her own, and she could have such a natural looking
wig made of it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, give you seventy-five dollars willingly;” she
said. “But it seems very mean and selfish in me to take
it,” she continued; and Rossie, fearful lest the bargain
should fall through, answered eagerly:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, no, it don’t. I want the money very much indeed.
I am anxious to sell it, and, if you do not buy it,
I shall go to some one else. But you must not ask me
why,—I can’t tell that; only, it is not for myself,—it’s
for a friend; I don’t think the hair worth seventy-five
dollars, but that is what I must have, and so I asked it.
Maybe if you can give me fifty, and loan me twenty-five,
I can pay it when my allowance is due.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>“You conscientious little chit,” Bee said, laughingly,
“you have not yet learned the world’s creed,—take
all you can get. I am willing to give you seventy-five
dollars, and, even at that price, think it cheap. But
you are a little girl, and will not look badly with short
hair.”</p>

<p class='c011'>With her natural shrewdness and her knowledge of
some of Everard’s shortcomings, Bee guessed that it was
for him the sacrifice was made, and, when the barber’s scissors
gleamed among the shining tresses, she saw that they
did not cut too close and make the girl a fright. But
the loss of her hair changed Rossie very much, and when
she went back to the Forrest House she shrank from the
eyes of the servants, and stole up to her own room,
where she could inspect herself freely, and see just how
she looked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, how ugly I am, and how big my eyes are!”,
she said, and two hot tears rolled down her cheeks; but
she resolutely dashed them away, and thought, “His
mother would be so glad if she knew I was doing it for
him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And the memory of the dead woman, who had been
so kind to her, helped her. For her sake she could bear
almost anything, and, putting on her hat, she left the
house again, going this time to the office of the family
lawyer, Mr. Russell, a kind, elderly man, who was very
fond of Rossie, and at once put aside his papers when
she came in.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Can I do anything for you to-day?” he asked, and
she replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ve come to ask you to write me just such a receipt
as you would write if somebody owed you seventy-five
dollars and you paid it in full. Don’t ask me anything,
only write it, and make it read as if the debtor didn’t
owe the creditor a penny after the date.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Russell looked curiously at the flushed face raised
so eagerly to him, and in part guessed her secret. Like
Bee, he knew of Everard’s expensive habits, and suspected
that this money had something to do with him.
But he merely said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“What name shall I use? The receipt will read like
this: ‘Received of,—blank,—seventy-five dollars,’ and
so forth. Now, how shall I fill the blank?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>Rossie thought a moment, and then replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Will it make any difference who writes the receipt?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not at all; the signature is what gives it its
value.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then will you please give me a form,—a true one,
you know,—which I can copy and send, and ought I not
to register the letter to make it safe?”</p>

<p class='c011'>She was quite a little business woman, and the old
lawyer looked at her admiringly as he gave her the necessary
directions, suggesting that a draft or post-office
order would be better than to send the money. But
Rossie did not care for so much publicity as she fancied
drafts and post-office orders would involve. She preferred
to send the bills, a fifty, a twenty, and a five,
directly to <em>Joe</em>, and she did so that very afternoon, for,
as good luck would have it, Beatrice asked her to drive
to an adjoining town, where she registered and posted
her letter, and felt as if a weight were lifted from her
mind. She had no suspicion of <em>Joe’s</em> playing her false.
He would, of course, return the receipt, and Mr. Everard
would be free, and her heart was almost as light as her
head when she returned home and went to Everard’s
room. That poor shorn head, how it stared at her in the
glass, and how she tried to brush up the short, wavy hair,
and make the most of it. But do the best she could, she
presented rather a forlorn appearance when she went in
to Everard, and asked him how he was.</p>

<p class='c011'>He had missed her very much that day, and greeted
her with a bright smile, so much like himself, that she
exclaimed, joyfully:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Mr. Everard, you are better; you are almost
well!”</p>

<p class='c011'>He was better, but his mind was still unsettled, and
running upon the <em>scrape</em> from which Rossie was to extricate
him, and he said to her:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Have you fixed it yet? Is it all right?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, all right,” she answered; and he continued:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Every single bit right? Am I cut loose from the
whole thing?”</p>

<p class='c011'>She thought he was, and soothed him into quiet until
he suddenly noticed her head, and exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Halloa, what have you been doing? Where’s your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>hair? Have you taken it off and laid it in the drawer
as mother used to do? I thought yours was a different
sort from that; not store hair, but genuine. I say,
Rossie, you look like a guy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She knew he was not responsible for what he said,
but it hurt her all the same, and tears sprang to her
eyes as she answered him:</p>

<p class='c011'>“My hair was very heavy and very warm this hot,
sultry weather. I am sorry you do not like my looks.
It will grow again in time.”</p>

<p class='c011'>That was Rossie’s one comfort. Her hair would
grow again, and she met bravely the exclamations of her
girl friends and of the servants, who asked her numberless
questions. But she kept her own counsel, and
waited impatiently for the assurance that the money had
gone in safety to Holburton. It came at last, on the
very day when Everard began to seem like himself, and
spoke to those about him rationally and naturally. His
reason had returned, and his first question to Rossie was
to ask if any letters had come to him during his illness,
and his second, to interrogate her with regard to her
hair, and why she had cut it off. She told him the old
story of its being heavy and warm, and then hastened to
bring his letters, of which she had taken charge. She
was certain that some of them were from Joe Fleming,
though the handwriting was much finer than that which
had come to her in that morning’s mail. <em>Joe</em> had sent
back the receipt without a word of comment, but Rossie
did not care for that; she only felt that Everard was
free, and she had the receipt in her pocket, and her face
was almost pretty in her bright eagerness and gladness
as she came to his bedside and handed him his letters.
Three were from college chums, and three from Josephine.
These he opened first, beginning with the one
bearing the oldest date. She had not then heard of his
mother’s death, and she wrote for more money,—twenty-five
dollars more, which were absolutely needed.
Seventy-five in all it was now, and the perspiration
started from every pore and stood thickly on Everard’s
forehead and about his lips, as, with an involuntary
moan, he dropped the letter from his nerveless hand and
turned his eyes toward Rossie, not with a thought that
she could help him, only with a feeling that he would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>tell her, and ask her what to do, and if it were not
better to leave college at once, acknowledge his marriage,
and hire out as a day laborer, if nothing better
offered.</p>

<p class='c011'>She saw the hunted, hopeless expression in his eyes,
and guessed the cause of it. In hers there was a great
gladness shining, as she said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am almost certain that letter is from Mr. Joe
Fleming, and I have one from him, too, or rather, a
receipt in full for the gambling debt!” and taking the
receipt from her pocket, she handed it to Everard, and
watched him while he read it.</p>

<p class='c011'>There it was in black and white, an acknowledgment
of seventy-five dollars, and a receipt in full of all Everard
Forrest’s indebtedness to Joe Fleming up to that
date. What did it mean? What could it mean? Everard
asked, while through his mind there flitted a vague
remembrance of something about Joe, and money, and
the scrape from which Rossie was to extricate him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Rossie, tell me, what do you know of Joe? What
does it mean?” he asked, and then Rossie told him how
he had raved about a <em>Joe</em>, to whom he said he owed
money, and how once, when he seemed a little rational,
she had questioned him, and found out that the man was
Joe Fleming, who lived in Holburton, and to whom he
owed fifty dollars which he could not pay.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You had your best clothes in your valise on the
bed, and were going to sell them to get it,” Rossie said,
“and I felt so sorry for you that I wrote to Mr. Fleming
myself, and told him what I thought about such debts,
and how sick and crazy you were, and your mother just
dead, and you no way to pay, and asked him to give up
the debt.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, yes,” Everard gasped, while his face grew
white as ashes; and still he could not forbear a smile at
the mistake with regard to Joe’s sex, a mistake of which
he was very glad, however. “Yes,” he continued, “you
wrote all this, and what was the reply?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Just what you might expect from the bad, unprincipled,
grasping man,” Rossie said, energetically, shaking
her shorn head. “I told him it was wrong to gamble
and tempt you to play, and told him how sick you were,
and how angry your father would be, and added that, if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>after all this, he still insisted upon the money, he was
not to trouble you, but write directly to me, and he was
mean enough to do it. He said he was sorry you were
sick, but he must have the money, and that you owed
him seventy-five, and you would tell me he had a right
to ask it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” Everard said again, but the yes was like a
groan, and every muscle of his face twitched painfully,
“yes. He wrote this to you, and you raised the money;
but how?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Rosamond hesitated a moment, and then replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you remember I told you that Miss Belknap
once offered to buy my hair?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Rossie!” Everard exclaimed, as the truth
flashed upon him, making the plain face of that heroic
little girl seem like the face of an angel,—“oh, Rossie,
you sold your beautiful hair for me, a scamp, a sneak, a
coward! Oh, why did you humiliate me so, and make
me hate and loathe myself?” and in his great weakness
and utter shame Everard covered his face with his hands
and sobbed like a child.</p>

<p class='c011'>Rosamond was crying, too,—was shedding bitter
tears of disappointment that she had made the great
sacrifice for nothing except to displease Mr. Everard.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Forgive me,” she said at last, “I thought you
would like it. I did not want you to sell your clothes,—did
not want your father to know. I meant to do right.
I am sorry you are angry.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Angry!” and in the eyes which looked at Rossie
there was anything but anger. “I am not angry except
with myself; only I am so mortified, so ashamed. I
think you the dearest, most unselfish person in the world.
Who else would have done what you have?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, ever so many,” Rossie said, “if they were sorry
for you and loved you; for, Mr. Everard, I am so sorry,
and I love you a heap, and then,—and then, I did it
some because I thought your mother would like it if she
knew.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Rosamond’s lip quivered as she said this, and there
was such a pitiful look in her soft eyes that Everard
raised himself in bed, and drawing her toward him, took
the thin little face between his hands and kissed it tenderly,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>while his tears flowed afresh at the mention of his
dead mother, who had been so much to him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Rossie,” he said, “what can I ever do to show you
how much I appreciate all you have done for, and all
you are to me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The girl hesitated a moment, and then said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you will promise never to have anything to do
with Joe Fleming, I shall be so happy, for I am sure he
is a bad man, and leads you into mischief. Will you
promise not to go near Joe Fleming again?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Everard groaned as he answered her:</p>

<p class='c011'>“You do not know what you ask. I cannot break
with Joe Fleming. I,—oh, Rossie, I am a coward, a
fool, and I wish I were dead,—I do, upon my word!
But there is one thing I can promise you, and I will. I
pledge myself solemnly, from this day forth, never to
touch a card of any kind in the way of gambling, never
to touch a drop of spirits, or a cigar, or a fast horse, or
to bet, or do anything of which you would not approve.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am so glad,” Rossie said, “and to make it quite
sure, suppose you sign something just as they do the
pledge to keep from drinking.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He did not quite know what she meant, but he answered,
unhesitatingly:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll sign anything you choose to bring me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m going to write it now,” Rossie said, and the
next moment she left the room, and Everard was free to
finish his letters alone.</p>

<p class='c011'>Taking the second one from Josephine, he read that
she was sorry to hear of his affliction, and wished she
could comfort him, and that it must be a consolation for
him to know that his mother was in heaven, where he
would one day meet her if he was a good man.</p>

<p class='c011'>This attempt at piety disgusted Everard, who knew
how little Josephine cared for anything sacred, and
how prone she was to ridicule what she called pious
people.</p>

<p class='c011'>Immediately following this mention of his mother,
she said she was missing and longing for him so much,
and hoped he would write at once, and send her the
money for which she was obliged to ask him. Then she
added the following:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I find myself in rather a peculiar position. So long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>as I am known as Miss Fleming, I shall of course be subject
to the attentions of gentlemen, and what am I to
do? Shall I go on as usual,—discreetly, of course,—and
receive whatever attentions are paid to me, never allowing
any one to get so far as an offer? I ask you this
because I wish to please you, and because, since my marriage,
it seems as if so many men were inclined to be
polite to me. Even old Captain Sparks, the millionaire,
has asked me to ride after his fast horses; and as there
was no reason which I could give him why I should not,
I went, and he acted as silly as an old fool well can act.
Tell me your wishes in the matter, and they shall be to
me commands.”</p>

<p class='c011'>For an instant Everard felt indignant at Captain
Sparks for presuming to ride with and say silly things
to Josephine, but when he reflected a moment he knew
that to the captain there was no reason why he should
not do so. Josephine was to him a young, marriageable
maiden, and rumor said that the old man was looking
for a fourth wife, and as he would, of course, look only
at the young girls, it was natural for him to single out
Josephine as an object of favor.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Josey must, of course, hold her place as an unmarried
person,” he thought, “but oh! the horror of this deception.
I’d give worlds to undo the work of that night.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He thought so more than ever when he read the third
and last letter, in which, after expressing her sorrow and
concern for his sickness, she told him of her correspondence
with Rosamond, and which, as it gives a still clearer
insight into the young lady’s character, we give, in part,
to the reader:</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Everard</span>:—What <em>do</em> you suppose has happened?
Why, I laughed until I nearly split my sides,
and I almost scream every time I think of the funny letter
I got from Rosamond Hastings, the little girl who
lives with you, and who actually thinks I am a <em>man</em>, a
bad, good for nothing, gambling, swearing <em>man</em>, who
leads you into all sorts of scrapes, and to whom you owe
money. It seems she gathered this when you were crazy,
and took it upon herself to write to <em>Mr. Joe Fleming</em>;—that’s
what she called me,—and lecture him soundly on
his badness. You ought to hear her once; but I’ll keep
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>the letter and show you. She wished me to give up the
debt, which she took for granted was a gambling one, but
said if I would not I must write to <em>her</em> and not trouble
you. Now, I suppose it would have been generous and
nice in me to say I did not care for the money, but you
see I did; I must have it to pay my bills; and so I wrote
to her and said <em>you</em> would tell her my claim was a
just one, if she asked you about it. In due time she
sent me seventy-five dollars, though how she raised it I
am sure I cannot guess, unless she coaxed it from your
father, and I hardly think she did that, as she seemed in
great fear lest he should know that you owed <em>Joe
Fleming</em>! She is a good business woman,—for, accompanying
the money was a receipt, correctly drawn up, and
declaring you discharged in full from all indebtedness
to me. I wonder what the child would have done if I
had not returned it, and just for the mischief of it I
thought once I wouldn’t, for a while at least, and see
what she would do. But Agnes made such a fuss that
I thought better of it, and shall send the receipt in the
same mail which takes this to you. By the way, you’ve
no idea how much Agnes has you and your interests at
heart. I believe, upon my word, she thinks you did a
dreadful thing to marry me as you did, and she says her
prayers in your behalf, to my certain knowledge, three
or four times a day. Verily, it ought to make your
calling and election sure.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dr. Matthewson was in town yesterday, and inquired
particularly for you. I told him of your mother’s
death, and that I had written to Clarence as he bade me
do, and made inquiries about him, and had not received
a very good report of his character as a clergyman. He
took it good-humoredly, and said that the Gospel didn’t
agree with him very well. I like the doctor immensely,
he is so amusing and friendly. I hope you will not care
because I told him of Rosamond’s mistake, and showed
him her letter. How he did roar! Why, he actually
laid down on the grass, and rolled and kicked, and would
not believe me till I showed him the letter. He left
town this morning, saying he should be here again in
the fall, and would like to board with mother.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How I hate this life,—planning how to get your
bread and butter,—and how glad I shall be when I am
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>out of it; but I mean to be patient and bear it, knowing
what happiness there is in the future for me. When
shall I see you, I wonder? Will you not come as soon
as you are able to travel and spend the remainder of
your vacation with me? You will at least stop here on
the way to Amherst, and for that time I live.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>It would be impossible to describe the nature of
Everard’s feelings as he read this letter, which seemed
to him coarse, and selfish, and heartless in the extreme.
Couldn’t Josephine, understand such a character as
Rossie’s, or appreciate the noble thing she had done?
Could she only see in it a pretext for laughing till “she
split her sides,” and was it a nice thing in her to tell Dr.
Matthewson of the letter, and even show it to him,
making him roll on the grass, and <em>roar</em> and <em>kick</em> in her
presence? Had she no delicacy or refinement, to allow
such a thing? Would any man dare do that with Bee or
even Rossie, child though she was? Was Josey devoid of
that womanly dignity which puts a man always on his best
behavior? He feared she was, he said sadly to himself,
as he recalled the free and easy manner he had always
assumed with her. How many times had he sat with his
feet higher than his head, and smoked directly in her
face, or stretching himself full length upon the grass
while she sat beside him, laid his head in her lap and
talked such slang as he would blush to have Rossie hear;
and she had laughed, and jested, and allowed it all, or
at the most reproved him by asking if he were not
ashamed of himself. Josey was <em>not</em> modest and womanly,
like his mother, and Bee, and Rosamond. She was
not like them at all, and for a moment there swept over
the young man such a feeling of revulsion and disgust
that his whole being rose up against the position in
which he was placed, and from his inmost soul he cried
out, “I cannot have it so!”</p>

<p class='c011'>He had sown the wind, and he was beginning to reap
the whirlwind; and it was a very nervous, feverish
patient which Rossie found when she came back to him,
bringing the paper he was to sign, and which was to
keep him straight. She called it a pledge, and it read:</p>

<p class='c013'>“I hereby solemnly promise never to drink a drop of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>liquor, never to smoke a pipe or cigar, never to race with
fast horses, never to play cards or any other game for
money, never to bet, and to have just as little to do with
Joe Fleming as I possibly can.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Signed by me, at the Forrest House, this —— day of
August, 18—.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There!” Rossie said, as she read it to him, and
offered him the pen; “you’ll sign that and then be very
safe.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Rossie,” he said vehemently, “I wish to Heaven I
could honorably subscribe to the whole of it, but I cannot.
I must erase the part about Joe Fleming. I cannot
explain to you why, but I must keep my acquaintance
with Joe, but I’ll promise not to be influenced in that
direction any more. Will that do?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, but I did so hope you would break with him
entirely. I know he makes you bad. You told me when
you came home you had no debts, and I believed you,
and yet you owed this man seventy-five dollars, and I
was so sorry to find you did not tell me true.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Rossie’s eyes were full of tears as she said this, for
losing faith in Everard had hurt her sorely, but he hastened
to reassure her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Rossie,” he said, “I did not know of this debt
then. It has come up since. What I told you was told
in good faith. Bad as I am, I would not tell a deliberate
lie, and you must believe me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She did believe him, and watched him as he put his
pen through the sentence, “have just as little to do with
Joe Fleming as I possibly can,” and then signed his
name to the paper.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There!” he said, as he handed it to her with a
sickly effort to smile. “Keep it, Rossie, and if I break
that pledge, may I never succeed in anything I undertake
so long as I live; and now bathe my head with the
coldest ice-water in the house, for it feels as if there was
a bass drum in it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He was very restless and nervous, and did not improve
as fast as the doctor had said he would, if once
his reason returned. Indeed, for a few days he did not
seem to improve at all, and Beatrice and Rosamond both
nursed him tenderly, and pitied him so much when they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>saw him lying so weak and still, with his eyes shut, and
the great tears rolling down his face.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s for his mother,” Rossie whispered to her companion,
and her own tears gathered as she remembered
the sweet woman whose grave was so fresh in the church-yard.</p>

<p class='c011'>But it was not altogether for the dead mother that
Everard’s tears were shed. It was rather from remorse
and sorrow for the deed he would have given so much
to undo; for he was conscious of an intense desire to be
free from the chain which bound him. Not free from
Josephine, he tried to make himself believe, for if that
were so he would indeed be the most wretched of men,
but free from his marriage vow, made so rashly. How
was it that he was tempted to do it? he asked himself, as
he went over in his mind with the events of that night.
He was always more or less intoxicated with Josephine’s
beauty when he was with her, and he remembered how
she had bewitched and bewildered him with the touch of
her soft hands, and sight of her bare arms and neck.
She had challenged him to the act, and Dr. Matthewson
had given him the wine, which he knew now must have
clouded his reason and judgment, and so he was left to
his fate. And a terrible one it seemed, as, in his weakness
and languor, he looked at it in all its aspects, and
saw no brightness in it. Even Josephine’s beauty
seemed fading into nothing, though he tried so hard to
keep his hold on that, for he must hold to something,—must
retain his love for <em>her</em> or go mad. But she was so
unlike Beatrice, so unlike Rosamond, so unlike what his
mother had been, and they were his standards for all
that was noble, and pure, and sweet in womankind. Josey
was selfish and unrefined; he could not put it in any
milder form when he remembered the past as connected
with her, and remembered how she had ridiculed little
Rossie Hastings, whose letter she had shown to Dr.
Matthewson. How plainly he could see that scene, when
the doctor rolled upon the grass and roared and kicked,
and Josephine laughed with him at the generous, unselfish
child who, to save him, had sacrificed her only
beauty. And Josephine was his wife, and he must not
cease to respect her one iota, for that was his only chance
for happiness, and he struggled so hard to keep her in his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>heart and love that it is not strange the great drops of
sweat stood thickly on his brow, or that the hot tears at
intervals rolled down his cheeks.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was Rossie who brushed them away, Rossie who
wiped the sweat from his face, and whispered to him once:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t cry, Mr. Everard. Your mother is so happy
where she has gone, and I don’t believe she has lost all
care for you either, she loved you so much when she was
here.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Everard broke down entirely, and holding Rossie’s
little, brown, tanned hands in his, said to her:</p>

<p class='c011'>“It isn’t that, though Heaven knows how much I
loved my mother, and how sorry I am she is dead; but
there are troubles worse than death, and I am in one now,
and the future looks so dark and the burden so heavy to
carry.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Can I help you bear it?” Rossie asked, softly, with
a great pity in her heart for this young man who had
given way like a child.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, Rossie, nobody can help me,—nobody,” he said;
and after a moment Rossie asked timidly: “Is it Joe
Fleming again?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, Rossie, Joe Fleming again;” and Everard
could scarcely restrain a smile, even in his grief, at this
queer mistake of Rossie’s.</p>

<p class='c011'>In her mind Joe Fleming was a dreadful man, through
whom Mr. Everard had come to grief, and she ventured
at last to speak of him to Beatrice as somebody of whom
Everard had talked when he was crazy, and who had led
him into a great trouble of some kind.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And that’s what ails him now, and keeps him so
weak and low, and makes him cry like a girl,” she said.</p>

<p class='c011'>And then Beatrice resolved to help the sick youth, if
possible, and that afternoon when she sat alone with him
for a few moments, she said to him:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Everard, I am quite sure that something is troubling
you, something which retards your recovery. I do not
ask to know what it is, but if money can lighten it let
me help you, please. I have so much more than I know
what to do with. Let me lend you some, do.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Bee,” Everard cried, “don’t talk to me that
way; you will kill me, you and Rossie together; and
you can’t help me. Nobody can. It is past all help.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>She did not at all know what he meant, but with her
knowledge of what money could do, she felt sure it
could help, and so she said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not so bad as that, I am sure. You have probably
been led astray by some designing person, but there is
always a backward path, you know, and you will take it
sure; and if you should want money, as you may, will
you ask me for it, Everard? Will you let me give it to
you, as if I were your sister?”</p>

<p class='c011'>He did not know; he could not tell what he might
do in sore need, for he felt intuitively that the call on
him for money, commenced so soon, would increase with
every year; so he thanked her for her kind offer, which,
he said, he would consider, should the time ever come
when he wanted help.</p>

<p class='c011'>For ten days more Everard kept his room, and then
arose suddenly one morning and said that he was able to
go back to college, where he ought to have been two
weeks ago, for he was getting far behind his class, and
would have to study hard to overtake and keep up with
it as he meant to do. Nothing could restrain him; go
he must, and go he did, early one morning in September,
before the people of Rothsay were astir. He had held
a short conference with Rosamond, and bidden her tell
the postmaster to forward to Amherst any letters which
might come to him, and on no account let them go to
the Forrest House. And Rossie had promised to
comply with all his wishes, and pressed upon him a
twenty-dollar bill which she made him take, because, as
she said, she did not need it a bit, and should just
squander it for peanuts, and worsteds, and things which
would do her no good. It was a part of her quarterly
interest, and she could do what she liked with it, and so
Everard took it, and felt humiliated, and hated himself,
especially as he knew just where the money would go.
A letter from Josephine had come to him, asking for
more funds, with which to replenish her wardrobe for
the autumn. They had no boarders now except Dr.
Matthewson, who was occasionally in town for a day or
two and stopped with them, and Mrs. Fleming did not
get as much sewing as usual, and so Josey was compelled
to come to her husband for money, though sorely against
her will, for she feared she must seem mercenary to him,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>and she hoped he would forgive her and love her just
the same.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was this letter which had determined him to return
to Amherst without delay. On his way thither, he
should stop in Holburton over a train, and tell Josephine
how impossible it was for him to supply her demands
until in a position to help himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If father would only give me something more than
my actual needs,” he thought; and, strangely enough, his
father did.</p>

<p class='c011'>Possibly the memory of the dead mother pleaded for
her boy, and prompted the judge to give his son at parting
a fifty-dollar bill over and above what he knew was
needed for board and tuition.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Make it go as far as you can; it ought to last you
the whole year,” he said, and Everard’s spirits sank like
lead as he foresaw the increasing drain there would be
on him, and felt how impossible it would be to ask his
father for more.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was still his best suit of clothes; and a little
diamond pin and a ring Rossie had given him, and his
books, which he could sell, and perhaps he could find
something to do after study hours which would bring
him money. He might write for the magazines or illustrate
stories; he had a natural taste for drawing, and
could dash off a sketch from nature in a very few minutes.
He could do something, he assured himself, and
his heart was a little lighter, when he at last said good-by
to Rossie and his father, and started northward for
college and Josephine.</p>

He had sent no word of his coming, for he did
not know just when he should reach Holburton.
His strength might fail him, and he be
obliged to stop for the night on the road.
But he kept up wonderfully, and arrived at
Holburton on the same train which had taken him there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>from Ellicottville on that memorable day which he would
gladly have stricken out. There was no one at the little
station except the ticket agent, who, being new to the
place, scarcely noticed him as he crossed the platform
and passed down the street toward the brown house on
the common. There had been a storm of wind and rain
the previous day, and the hop vine, which in the summer
grew over the door, was torn down and lay upon the
ground. A part of the fence, too, was nearly down, and
a shutter hung by one hinge and swayed to and fro in
the autumn wind. Taken as a whole, the house presented
rather a forlorn appearance, and he found himself wondering
how he had ever thought it so attractive. And
still he felt his blood stir quickly at the thought of meeting
Josephine again, and he half looked to see her come
flying out to meet him as she had sometimes done. But
only the cat, who was chasing a grasshopper through the
uncut grass, came to welcome him by purring and rubbing
herself against his legs as he went up the walk.</p>

<p class='c011'>Agnes let him in,—the same sun-bonnet on her head
he had seen so many times, her sleeves rolled up, and
her wide apron smelling of the suds she had come
from.</p>

<p class='c011'>At sight of him she uttered an exclamation of surprise,
and for a moment her tired face lighted up with
something like pleasure; then that expression faded and
was succeeded by an anxious, startled look, as she glanced
nervously down the road as if expecting some one to
whom she would give warning. Mrs. Fleming was in
Boston, seeing to some mortgage on the house, and Josey
had gone to ride, she said, as she led the way into the
little parlor, which, even to Everard’s not very critical
eye, presented an appearance of neglect unusual in Mrs.
Fleming’s household. Evidently it had not been cared
for that day, for the chairs were moved from their
places, two standing close together, just where their last
occupants had left them. There were crumbs of cake
on the carpet, and two empty wineglasses on the table,
with a fly or two crawling lazily on the inside and sipping
the few red drops left there.</p>

<p class='c011'>As Agnes opened the window and brushed up the
crumbs, she said she was intending to right up the room
before Josephine came home, then, bidding Everard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>make himself as comfortable as possible, she left him
alone, and went back to her work in the kitchen.</p>

<p class='c011'>Taking a chair near the window, where he could command
a view of the street, the young man sat waiting
for Josephine, until he heard at last a loud, long laugh,
which was almost a shriek, and, looking through the
shutters of the open window, he saw first a cloud of dust,
and then a low buggy coming rapidly across the common,
in the direction of the house. In the buggy sat
Captain Sparks, the millionaire, whose <i><span lang="fr">penchant</span></i> for
young and pretty girls was well known throughout the
entire county. Short, fat and grizzly, he sat with folded
arms, smiling complacently upon the fair blonde, who, in
her brown silk dress of two shades, with a long white
lace scarf twisted round her hat and flying far behind,
held the reins of the high-mettled horse, and was driving
furiously. In his surprise and indignation, Everard
failed to note how beautiful she was, with the flush of
excitement on her cheeks and the sparkle in her eye; he
only thought she was his wife, and that Captain Sparks
lifted her very tenderly to the ground, and held her by
the shoulders a moment, while he said something which
made her turn her head coquettishly on one side, as she
drew back from him, and said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“You mean old thing! You ought to be ashamed!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Everard had heard this form of expression many
times. Indeed, it was her favorite method of reproof
for liberties of speech or manner, and meant nothing at
all. Everard knew it did not, and Captain Sparks knew
it did not, and held her hand the tighter; but she drew
it away at last, and ran gayly up the walk, throwing him
a kiss from the tips of her daintily-gloved hand. Then
she entered the side door, and Everard heard her say to
Agnes, who was hurrying to meet her and announce his
arrival:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Upon my word, if you are not in that old wash-dud
yet! I’ll bet you haven’t touched the parlor, and the
captain is coming at eight o’clock. <em>Wha-a-t?</em>” and her
voice fell suddenly, as Agnes said something to her in a
tone too low for Everard to hear.</p>

<p class='c011'>That it concerned him and his presence there he was
sure, and he was not greatly surprised when the next
instant the door opened swiftly, and Josephine rushed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>headlong into his arms. He opened them involuntarily
to withstand the shock, rather than to receive her; but
the result was the same,—she laid her golden head on his
bosom and sobbed like a child. Josey could feign a cry
admirably when she chose to do so, and now she trembled
and shook, and made it seem so real that Everard
forgot everything except that she was very fair and undeniably
glad to see him. Very gently he soothed her,
and made her lift her head, that he might look into her
face, and hated himself for thinking that for such a
thunder-gust as she had treated him to her eyes were not
very red, nor her cheeks very wet. But she was so happy,
and so glad he had come, and so sorry she was not
there to receive him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That old fool, Captain Sparks, had recently taken to
haunting her with attentions, and as the easiest way to
be rid of him, she had consented for once to ride with
him, and had taken the occasion to tell him it could not
be repeated. But then it was rare fun to drive his fast
horse,—she was so fond of driving, and Blucher was so
fleet and spirited, and had brought them up to the house
in such style. Did Everard see them,—and what did he
think?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I saw you, and thought you were enjoying it
hugely,” Everard said; and Josey detected something in
his tone which made her suspect that he did not quite
like the captain’s manner of lifting her from the carriage.
But she was equal to the emergency, and made
fun of the old man, and called him a love-sick muff, and
took him off to the life, and then, in a grieved, martyred
kind of way, said, “it was rather hard for her to know
just what to do, situated as she was, married, and yet not
married, in fact. She would not for the world do anything
to displease Everard, but must she decline all attention
and make a nun of herself, and how soon could
she let her marriage be known?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not yet, Josey,” Everard said, explaining to her
rapidly how much worse the matter was for them now
his mother was dead.</p>

<p class='c011'>She might, and would, have helped them when the
crisis came, but now there was no one to stand between
him and his father, who was sure to take some desperate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>step if he knew of the rash marriage before his son was
through college.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We must wait, Josey, two years, sure,” he said;
and, because she could not help herself, Josephine
assented, very sweetly, though with something of an
injured air, and managed next to speak of money, and
asked if he hated her for being such a <em>leech</em>.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You mustn’t, for I couldn’t help it,” she said, and
she leaned on his arm, and buttoned and unbuttoned his
coat, and caressed him generally, as she continued:
“Maybe you didn’t know how poor the bride was, or
you would not have taken her. Mother is in Boston
now about some mortgage on the house, and it takes so
much to live decently, and my lessons cost frightfully;
but you are glad to have me improve, dearest?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Of course he was glad, he said, but he had no means
of getting money except from his father, and if she
knew to what humiliation he was subjected when he
asked for funds, she would spare him all she could. By
and by, when he had money of his own, there should be
no stint, but now she must be economical, he told her;
and then she spoke of Rosamond, and asked who and
what that queer little old-fashioned thing could be.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Such a lecture as she gave Mr. Joe Fleming for
gambling, and leading you wrong generally. Why, I
laugh till I cry every time I think of it,” Josey said,
proving the truth of what she asserted by laughing
heartily.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the laugh grated on Everard, as in some way an
affront to Rossie, and he shrank from saying much of
her, except to tell who she was, and how she came to be
living at the Forrest House.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And was it her own money she sent me, or where
did she get it? Has she the open sesame to your father’s
purse? If so, you had better apply to her, when in
need,” Josey said; and in a sudden spasm of fear lest in
some way Rossie should become a victim of the greed he
was beginning dimly to comprehend, he told the story
of the hair, but withheld the name of Beatrice, from a
feeling that he would rather Josephine should not know
of his acquaintance with her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What do you think of a girl who could do so generous
a thing as that for a great lout like me?” he asked,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>and Josephine replied, “I think she was a little goose!
Catch me parting with my hair; though I am glad she
did it, as it relieved you, and was of great benefit to Joe
Fleming!”</p>

<p class='c011'>She laughed lightly, but Everard was disgusted and indignant
at her utter want of appreciation of the sacrifice
which few girls would have made. She saw the shadow
on his face, and, suspecting the cause, changed her tactics,
and became greatly interested in Rosamond, and said that
she must be a generous, self-denying little thing, and she
wished Everard would allow her to write to her in her
own proper character as his wife. But to this he would
not consent. He was not deceived by this change in her
manner. He knew Josey had expressed her real sentiments
at first, and there was in his heart a constantly increasing
sense of disappointment and loss of something,
he scarcely knew what. Nor could all Josephine’s wiles
and witcheries lift the shadows from his face, and make
him feel just as he used to do when he sat alone in the
little parlor with her at his side. She was very charming
in her brown silk, which fitted her admirably, and
Beatrice herself could not have been softer, and sweeter,
and gentler than she tried to be; but there was something
lacking, and though Everard put his arm around her
slender waist, and her golden head was pillowed on his
shoulder, his heart beat with heavy throbs of pain as he
spoke of her last letter to him, in which she had asked
for more money. It had been his intention to give her
all he had, and bid her make it last the year, but he
changed his mind suddenly, and handed her only twenty
dollars, and told her it was by mere chance that he was
fortunate enough to have so much to give her, and that
he hoped she would do the best she could with it; for,
though he would gladly give her ten times the amount,
if he could, the thing was impossible.</p>

<p class='c011'>She thanked him graciously, and said she meant to be
very economical, only things did cost so much, and as
Mrs. Forrest, she felt that she must dress better than
Josephine Fleming had done. If he said so she would
take in sewing, or even washing, if he liked,—anything
to show him she really meant to please him. He vetoed
the washing and the sewing, of course, and then, as he
heard the rattling of dishes in the adjoining room, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>hastened to say that he was to leave on the half-past
seven train, so as to reach Amherst that night. There
was a passionate protest, and a pretty, pouting declaration
that he did not care for her any more, and then she
allowed herself to be comforted, and felt really relieved
when she remembered Captain Sparks and his engagement
for eight o’clock. There were waffles for supper,—Everard’s
favorites,—and Josephine sat by him and
buttered them for him, and made his tea, and helped
him to peaches and cream, and between times studied the
face which baffled and puzzled her so, with its new expression,
born of remorse and harrowing unrest. She
had married a boy whom she thought to mold so easily,
but she found him now a man, for whom she felt a little
awe and fear, and there was something of real timidity
and shyness in her manner when at last she said good-by
to him, and watched him through the darkness as he
went rapidly from her to the train which was to take him
on his way to Amherst.</p>

It is not my intention to linger over the incidents
of the next two years, or more than
glance at the Forrest House, where Rosamond
Hastings laughed, and played, and
romped, gaining each day health, and
strength, and girlish beauty, but retaining always the
same straightforward, generous, self-denying, truthful
character which made her a favorite with every one.
To Everard she was literally a good angel, and never
was a son watched more carefully by an anxious mother
than she watched and guarded him. She wrote him
letters of advice and sage counsel such as a grandmother
of seventy might have written, and which
frequently had in them some word of warning against
bad associates in general, and Joe Fleming in particular.
She knew he had not broken with Joe altogether,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>for he told her so, and more than once in his sore
need he had taken the money she never failed to send
him when her quarterly allowance was paid. But for
the rest, he was manfully keeping to the pledge which
she had drawn for him to sign. Only once in all the two
years had he ventured to ask his father for more money
than that close-dealing man chose to give him, and the
storm of anger which that request had evoked determined
him never to repeat the act. He sent his father’s letter to
Josephine, that she, too, might understand how difficult
it was for him to supply her constantly increasing wants,
and for a time the effect was good; but an inordinate
fondness for dress was one of Josey’s weaknesses, and
having once indulged it to a certain extent she could not
readily deny herself, especially as she felt she had a right
to a part, at least, of the Forrest money. So she wrote to
Everard again and again, sometimes for five dollars, sometimes
for ten, or twenty, and when she found that sooner
or later it came she ventured to ask for more, and at last
demanded fifty dollars, which she needed for furs, as her
old ones were worn-out. Then Everard sold the little
diamond pin his mother had given him, and parted with
it almost without a pang, he was getting so accustomed
to these things. He had long before parted with his
best suit of clothes, and from the most exquisitely dressed
young man in college he was fast becoming the plainest,
and was getting the reputation of penuriousness in everything.
His first-class boarding-house was exchanged for
a third-rate club, where the poorest young men lived;
he wrote articles for the magazines and sold them for
whatever he could get, and once, when the janitor was
sick for a week, he took his place, and earned a few dollars
with which to swell the amount he found it necessary
to keep on hand for the woman who sported a
handsomer wardrobe than the greatest lady in Holburton.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of course the world must have some explanation for
this, or the girl’s reputation be ruined forever. And
Josey made the explanation, and said a distant relative
of her father’s had died in Ireland, and left her a few
pounds to do with as she liked. And in this story there
was a semblance of truth, for a maiden aunt, who for
years had lived in Portrush, on the northern coast of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>Ireland, and taken lodgers during the summer season,
did die and leave to her grand-nieces in America the sum
of fifty pounds, which was ostensibly divided between
Agnes and Josephine, though the latter had the greater
share, and immediately appeared on the street in an expensive
velvet sack, which attracted much attention and
elicited a great many remarks from those who were
watching the career of the young girl. She was not
popular, for with her fine dress she had also put on all
sorts of airs, and her manner was haughty and offensive
in the extreme, while her flirtations with gentlemen were
so marked as to make her notorious as a heartless and
unprincipled coquette. Captain Sparks had laid himself
and his immense fortune at her feet, only, of course, to
be refused; but she had told him no so sweetly, with
tears in her liquid blue eyes, that he was not more than
half convinced that she meant it, and dangled still in her
train of hangers-on. Dr. Matthewson, too, was there
frequently, and people had good reasons for thinking
him the favored one, judging from the familiar relations
in which they seemed to stand to each other. Once in a
great while Everard himself went over to Holburton, but
he never stopped more than a few hours at the most, and
was seldom seen in the street with Josephine, who was
supposed to have lost her hold on him,—and so in fact
she had; all his fancied love for her was dead, and her
beauty never moved him now, or made his pulses quicken
one whit faster than their wont. She was his wife,
and he accepted the fact, and resolved to make the best
of it, but the future held nothing bright in store for him.
On the contrary, he shrank from it with a kind of nervous
terror, and felt no throb of joy when his college
days drew near their close, and he knew that he stood
first in his class, and should graduate with every possible
honor. He had worked hard for that, but it was more to
please Beatrice and Rosamond than for any good to
himself that he had studied early and late, and made
himself what he was. They were coming on from Rothsay
with his father, to see him graduated, and hear his valedictory,
for that honor was awarded him, and he had engaged
rooms for them at a private house where he knew
they would be more comfortable than at the hotel. Rossie
was all eagerness and excitement, and wrote frequently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>to Everard, telling him once that if <em>Joe Fleming</em> was
there not to let him know who <em>she</em> was, but to be sure
to point <em>him</em> out to her, as she had a great desire to see a
real gambler and blackleg. She had recently applied this
last term to Joe Fleming, and Everard smiled when he read
the letter, but felt a great pang of fear lest Josephine
should thrust herself upon the notice of his father and
Beatrice. He had given her no hint that her presence
would be agreeable to him, but he knew she did not
need it, and was not at all disappointed when he received
a note from her saying that she was coming down to see
him graduate, but should not trouble him more than she
could help, as a friend who lived about a mile from
town had asked her to spend a few days with her, and
be present at the exercises. She should, of course,
expect him to call and pay her any little attention which
he consistently could.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was long since Josephine had attempted anything
like love-making with Everard, for she felt that he
understood her perfectly now, and had no respect whatever
for her. He had found her a sham, just as Rossie
had said she was, and had accepted his fate with a bitterness
and remorse such as few men of his age had ever
experienced. He did not believe in her at all, and whenever
he was with her, and met the soft, pleading glance
of the eyes which had once so fascinated and bewitched
him, he only felt indignant and disgusted, for he knew
how false it all was, and that the eyes which looked so
beseechingly up to him would the next hour rest as lovingly
upon Dr. Matthewson, or Captain Sparks, or any
other man whom she deemed worthy of her notice.
Once, when he was in Holburton, he accidentally discovered
that the washing and ironing, with which Agnes
seemed always busy, were done to pay the music bills and
sundry other expenses, for which he had sent the money,
and in his surprise he asked a few leading questions and
learned more than he had dreamed of. As the worm
will turn when trodden upon, so Agnes, who chanced to
be smarting under some fresh indignity imposed upon
her, turned upon her tyrant and told many things which,
for Everard’s peace of mind, would have been better
unsaid, for she dwelt mostly upon Josey’s free-and-easy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>manner with the gentlemen who came to the house to
call, or chanced to be boarding there.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t mean she does anything bad,” she said,
“anything you could <em>sue for</em> if you wanted to, but she
just <em>makes eyes</em> at them, and leads them on, and gets
them all dangling on her string, and wants to be their
<em>sister</em>, and all that sort of stuff, and when the fools offer
themselves, as some of them do, she rises up on her tiptoes
and wonders how they could presume to do such a
thing, as she had never meant to encourage them,—she
was simply their friend; and, if you’ll believe it, they
mostly stick to her just the same, and the <em>sister</em> business
goes on, and she a married woman! I’m sorry for you,
Mr. Forrest!”</p>

<p class='c011'>And oh, how sorry he was for himself, and how after
this revelation he shrank from the gay butterfly which
flitted around him so gracefully, and treated him to the
<em>eyes</em> of which Agnes had spoken so significantly. And
still there was no open rupture between the two, no
words of recrimination or reproach on either side. He
was always courteous and polite, though cold as the
polar sea; while she was sweetness itself, and only the
expression of her face told occasionally that she fully
realized the situation, and knew just how she stood with
him. But he was her husband, and as such would one
day be known to the world, and she was far prouder of
him now in his character as a man than she had been
when she took him, a boy; and she meant to see him on
the stage in Amherst, and compel him to pay her some
attention which should mark her as an object of preference.
She knew he did not wish to have her there, but
she did not care for that, and wrote to him her intention
to be present at the Commencement, and her wish that
he should pay her some attention.</p>

<p class='c011'>The old, weary, hopeless look, which had become
habitual to his face, deepened in intensity as Everard
read the note, and then began to calculate the chances
of a meeting between his friends and Josey. He was
very morbid about this secret, which he had kept so long
that it seemed to him now that he never could divulge
it, even if sure that his father’s bitter anger would not
follow. And he did not wish Beatrice and Rossie to see
his wife, if he could help it, and perhaps he could. There
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>would be a great crowd in the church; they could not
see her there; and, as Mrs. Everts lived more than a
mile from town, they might not meet her at all, unless at
the reception given by the president, and to this Josey
would hardly be invited. So he breathed a little more
freely, and completed his arrangements for his family,
and wrote a line to Josey, saying he would call upon her
at Mrs. Everts’ when she came, but should be so very
busy that he could not be with her a great deal.</p>

<p class='c011'>To Rosamond he wrote quite differently, and told her
how glad he was that she was coming, and how much he
hoped she would enjoy the trip, and that there was the
coziest, prettiest room imaginable waiting for her in one
of the pleasantest houses in town. And Rossie was
crazy with delight and anticipation, and scarcely slept a
wink the night before they started. And still she was
very bright, and fresh, and pretty, in her suit of Holland
linen, and never was journey more enjoyed than she enjoyed
hers, seeing everything, and appreciating everything,
and declaring that she was not a whit tired when
at last they reached Amherst, and found Everard waiting
for them.</p>

It was nearly a year since they had seen Everard,
and Bee and Rossie were struck at once
with the great change in his personal appearance,
while even the judge noticed how thin
and pale he was, but attributed it naturally
to hard study. Fresh air and exercise at home would
soon make that all right, he thought, and so dismissed it
from his mind. But Beatrice and Rosamond both saw
more than the thin face, which had grown so pale and
troubled. They saw that Everard’s hat was the same
worn the year before when he was at home; saw that
his pants were shining about the knees, and his coat
shining and worn about the sleeves, while his boots were
carefully patched. Once he had been the best and most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>fashionably-dressed young man in college, but he was
far from that now, though he was scrupulously neat and
clean, and looked every whit a gentleman as he walked
with the young ladies down the shaded street, and tried
to seem natural, and answer gayly to Beatrice’s light
badinage and Rossie’s quaint remarks. But it was uphill
business, for how could he be happy when he knew
that Josey would soon be watching for him, and expecting
him to pass a part of the evening, at least, with her?
What if she should take it into her head to come to town
and hunt him up, and find him there with his friends?
What could he say or do, and what would they think of
her? It made him faint and sick just to imagine Beatrice
weighing Josephine as she would weigh her, and
discovering more than the enormity of cotton lace and
dollar jewelry, while Rossie,—he could not define to himself
why he shrank so nervously from having her clear,
honest eyes scan Josephine Fleming, as he knew they
would do.</p>

<p class='c011'>After tea was over, Everard took his father through
the town and introduced him to some of the professors,
and then, as the twilight began to fall, asked to be excused
a short time, as he had an engagement to call upon
a friend; so his father returned alone to his lodgings,
and Everard started on a rapid walk toward Mrs. Everts’.
He did not know the lady personally, but he knew where
she lived, and was soon at her gate, where he paused a
moment in some surprise at the sounds of talking and
laughter which greeted his ears. The parlor was lighted
up, and through the open windows he caught a glimpse
of Josephine, fair and lovely, in pure white, with only a
bit of honeysuckle at her throat and in her hair, which
fell like a golden shower upon her neck, and gave her a
very youthful appearance. Gathered around her were
four young men, juniors and sophomores, each striving
for the preference, and each saying some soft thing to
her, at which she laughed so prettily and coquettishly
that their zeal and admiration were increased tenfold.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How did these puppies know her?” Everard asked
himself, as he leaned against the gate; then he remembered
having heard that one of them had spent a little
time in Holburton, and probably he was in the habit of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>going there occasionally, and had taken the others with
him.</p>

<p class='c011'>At all events she seemed to know them well, and
they were in the full tide of flattery and mirth when
his ring broke the spell, and he was ushered into the parlor.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I am so glad to see you!” Josey exclaimed, coming
gracefully forward, and giving him both her hands,
an act which was noted by the juniors and sophomores,
and mentally resented.</p>

<p class='c011'>What business had that grave, dignified Forrest
there, and why should Miss Fleming greet him so cordially,
and where did she know him anyway? They
had heard he was very wealthy, and that he once was
very fast and wild, but something had changed him
entirely, and transformed him into a sober, reticent, and,
as they believed, very proud and stingy young man,
whose perfectly correct behavior was a living rebuke to
themselves. He was not popular with their set, and
they showed it in their faces, and pulled at their cravats,
and fingered the bouquets in their button-holes, and
stood round awkwardly, while he talked with Josey, and
asked her of her journey, and her mother and Agnes,
and answered her questions about the exercises the next
day, and the best place for her to sit.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, we will arrange that; we will see that you
have a good seat,” the juniors and sophomores echoed in
chorus; and with a slight sneer, perceptible to Josey, on
his face, Everard said to her: “I do not see that there is
any chance for me to offer you any attention, you seem
so well provided for.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Josey bit her lip with vexation, for though she was
delighted to have so many admirers at her side, she would
far rather have been cared for particularly by this
husband, of whom she was beginning to be a good deal
afraid. He was so greatly changed that she could not
understand him at all, or guess what was passing in his
mind, and when at last he rose to go she said to him
almost beseechingly:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I hope I shall see you to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Possibly, though I shall be very busy,” was his
reply; and just then one of the juniors said to him:</p>

<p class='c011'>“By the way, Forrest, who is that fine-looking,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>elderly gentleman I saw with you this evening? Your
father?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, my father,” Everard replied, feeling a desire
to throttle the young man, and glancing involuntarily
at Josephine, over whom a curious change had come.</p>

<p class='c011'>The was a blood-red spot on her cheeks, and an
unnatural glitter in her eyes, as she said to the quartette
around her:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Excuse me a moment. I have just thought of something
which I particularly wish to say to Mr. Forrest.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The next moment she stood in the hall with him,
and was saying to him rapidly and excitedly: “Your
father is here, and you did not tell me. I don’t like
it. I wish to see him,—wish him to see me, and you
must introduce me at the reception. I intend to be
there.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very well,” was all Everard said, but he felt as if
a band of iron was drawn around his heart as he went
back to Beatrice and Rossie, who were waiting for him,
and who noticed at once the worried look upon his face,
and wondered a little at it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Had anything happened to disquiet him, that he
should seem so absent-minded and disturbed? Rossie
was the first to reach a solution of the mystery, and when
at his request Beatrice seated herself at the piano and
began to play, she stole up to him, and whispered very
low, “Have you seen Joe Fleming to-night?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” was his reply, and Rossie’s wise little nod
said plainly, “I guessed as much.”</p>

<p class='c011'>In her mind every trouble or perplexity which came
to Everard had something to do with the mysterious Joe
Fleming, though in what way she could not guess. She
only knew that it was so, and she felt an increased
desire to see this <i><span lang="fr">bete noir</span></i> of Mr. Everard’s.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And perhaps I shall have a chance to-morrow night
at the reception. It will be just like his impudence to
be there,” she thought, when at last she laid her tired
head upon her pillow.</p>

<p class='c011'>Rossie was very pale and haggard when she came
down to breakfast the next morning. She was accustomed
to the headache, and knew that one was coming
on, but she fought the pain back bravely, for she could
not miss the valedictory.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>It was comparatively early when she and Beatrice
entered the church, which, even at that hour, was densely
packed. But good seats were found for them, and
Rossie sat all through the exercises and listened breathlessly
to Mr. Everard’s oration, and threw him a bouquet,
and wondered who the beautiful lady was who
stood up on tiptoe to cheer him, and who seemed so
desirous that her bouquet of pansies and rose geraniums
should reach him in safety. Beatrice did not see the
lady, but she saw the bouquet of pansies which fell at
Everard’s feet, where he seemed disposed to let it lie,
until a boy picked it up and handed it to him. It was
very pretty, and the pansies showed well against the
background of green, but Beatrice little guessed how
faint and sick the young man felt as he held them with
the flowers Rossie had thrown. These he had picked up
himself, and smiled pleasantly upon the young girl, whose
pride and satisfaction shone in her brilliant eyes, and
whose face was almost as white as the dress she wore.
For Rossie was growing sick very fast, and when the
exercises were over she could not even wait to speak to
Everard, but hurried with Beatrice to her room, where
she went directly to bed.</p>

<p class='c011'>The reception was given up, but Rossie saw Everard
a moment and told him how proud she was of him, and
how fine she thought his valedictory.</p>

<p class='c011'>Everard’s spirits were much lighter now than they
had been in the morning, but when he remembered what
had lightened them, he felt himself a very brute and
monster, for it was nothing less than the sight of Rossie’s
pale, sick face, and the knowing that she would not attend
the reception, or Beatrice either, for the latter insisted
upon staying with the little girl, and said she was only
too glad to do so, for she did not care for the people she
should meet, and would much rather remain at home
with Rossie.</p>

It was a rather stupid affair, with a great many
more gentlemen than ladies. Indeed, there
were but very few of the latter present, and
these mostly the wives and daughters of the
professors, with any guests who chanced to
be visiting them, so that when Josephine entered the
room in her flowing robes of white, with her beautiful
hair falling down her back, she created a great sensation.
How she obtained an invitation to the reception it would
be difficult to tell, but obtained it she had, and had
spent hours over her dress, which was a master-piece of
grace and girlish simplicity. It was white tarlatan, which
fitted her perfectly, and left bare just enough of her
neck and arms to be becoming. Clusters of pansies looped
up the overdress, and formed her shoulder-knots, while
a bunch of the same flowers, mingled with sweet mignonette,
was fastened at her throat, and around her
neck was a delicate chain of gold from which was suspended
a turquoise locket, set with a few small pearls.
Everything about her, though not costly, was in perfect
taste, and she looked so charming, so fresh and lovely,
when she entered the hot parlor, accompanied by one of
the seniors, who was her escort, that the guests held
their breath for a moment to look at her; then the gentlemen
who knew her,—and there were a dozen or more
of them,—pressed eagerly forward, each ambitious to
pay her some attention.</p>

<p class='c011'>Everard was standing by his father and the president
when she came in, and at sight of her, smiling sweetly
and bearing herself so royally, he felt for an instant a
thrill of something like pride in her. But when he remembered
that this beauty, and grace, and sweetness
was all there was of the woman; that her manner was
studied, even to the smile on her lips and the expression
of her eyes, he turned from her with a feeling of disgust,
but glanced nervously at his father to see what
effect she would have upon him. Judge Forrest saw
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>her, and stopped a moment in the midst of something he
was saying to the president to look at her; then, moved
by one of those unaccountable prejudices which one
sometimes takes against a stranger without knowing
why, he turned his back and resumed his interrupted
conversation, and so he did not see young Allen, her attendant,
when he presented her to Everard as one whom
she had never met.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a comical gleam in Josey’s eyes, and Everard’s
face was scarlet as he said,</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have the pleasure of knowing Miss Fleming, I believe.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Seeing an opening in the crowd, Allen tried to pass
on; but Josey had no intention of leaving that locality,
and, as soon as she could, she disengaged herself from
him, and standing close to Everard, said, in a low tone:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Present me to your father.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He had no alternative but to obey, and in a few
moments Josey’s great blue eyes were looking up coyly
and deferentially at the stern old judge, and, a few moments
later, her arm was linked in his, and he was leading
her toward an open window, where it was cooler,
and the crowd was not so great. She had complained
that it was warm and close, and asked the judge if he
would mind taking her near the conservatory, where it
must be more comfortable.</p>

<p class='c011'>And so the judge gave her his arm and piloted her to
the window, where she got between him and the people
and compelled him to stand and listen, while she talked
in her most flattering strain, telling him how glad she
was to meet him, she had heard so much of him from his
son, who sometimes visited at her mother’s, and how
much he was like what she had fancied him to be from
Everard’s description, only so much more youthful
looking.</p>

<p class='c011'>If there was anything the judge detested it was for
an old man to look younger than his years. It was in
some sense a living lie, he thought, and he abominated
anything like deception. So when Josephine spoke of
his youthful appearance, he answered gruffly, “I am
sixty, and look every day of it. If I thought I didn’t,
I’d proclaim it aloud, for I hate deception of every
kind.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>“Yes, I should know you did, and there we agree
perfectly,” Josephine replied, and she leaned a little
more heavily upon his arm and made what Agnes called
her <em>eyes</em> at him, and asked him to hold her fan while she
buttoned her glove, and asked him about Charleston as
it was before the war, and wished that she could have
seen it in its glory.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you know,” and she spoke very low and looked
straight up into his face, “it is very naughty in me, I
admit, but at heart I believe I’m a bit of a <em>rebel</em>, and
though, of course, I was very young when the war broke
out, and didn’t quite know what it was about, I secretly
sympathized with <em>you</em> Southerners, and held a little jubilee
by myself when I heard of a Southern victory. Do
you think me a traitor?” and she smiled sweetly into the
face which never relaxed a muscle, but was cold and
frigid as ice.</p>

<p class='c011'>Judge Forrest was, to his heart’s core, a Southerner,
and had sympathized with his people during the rebellion,
because they were his people; but had he been born
North he would have been just as strong a Federal as he
was a Confederate, so, instead of thinking more highly
of Miss Josey for her rebel sentiments, he thought the
less of her, and answered rebukingly, “Young woman, I
do not quite believe you know all the word traitor implies;
if you did, you wouldn’t voluntarily apply it to
yourself.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, perhaps not. I’m a foolish, silly girl, I know,”
Josey answered him humbly, while great tears swam in
her blue eyes, but produced no effect upon the judge.</p>

<p class='c011'>Indeed, he scarcely saw them, he was so intent upon
ridding himself of this piece of affectation and vulgarity,
as he mentally pronounced her, and it was all in
vain that she practiced upon him the little coquetries
which she was wont to play off on other men with more
or less success. He did not care for her innocence, nor
her pretty pretense of ignorance of the world, nor timidity
nor shyness, nor love of books and poetry, nor admiration
of himself, for she tried all these, one after
another, and felt herself growing angry with this man
who stood so unmoved before her and seemed only anxious
to get away. She had made no impression on him whatever,
at least no good impression, and she knew it, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>resolved upon one final effort. He might be reached
through his son, and so she mentioned Everard, and complimented
his oration, and told how high he stood in the
estimation of the professors, and what an exemplary
young man he was, and ended by saying, “You must be
very proud of him, are you not?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Here was a direct question, but the judge did not
answer it. There was beginning to dawn upon him a suspicion
that this girl, whose flippant manner he so much
disliked, was more interested in his son than in himself,
and if so, possibly, his son was interested in her. At all
events he meant to know the extent of their acquaintance,
and instead of answering her question, he asked:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Have you known my son long?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Josey thought the truth would answer better than
equivocation, and she told him that Everard had boarded
with her mother a few weeks three years ago.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You remember,” she said, “he spent his long vacation
East, and a part of it in Holburton, where we live.
Perhaps you may have heard him speak of my mother.
She knew your wife well, and was at your wedding,
though you would not remember her, of course, among
so many strangers.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The judge did not remember her, nor could he recall
the name as one which he had ever heard, but he did not
think of doubting Josey’s word, and never suspected
that, though her mother had been present at his bridal,
it was as a former servant in the Bigelow family; he
only knew that if she had been the most intimate friend
of his wife, he did not like her daughter, and he greeted
with rapture the young man who at last appeared and
took her off his hands. Her attempt at familiarity with
him had failed, and she felt intensely chagrined, and mortified,
and disappointed, for she began to understand how
difficult it would be for Everard to confess his marriage,
and to fear the consequences if he did. A tolerably skillful
reader of human nature, she saw what kind of man
Judge Forrest was, and felt that Everard had not misrepresented
him. She saw, too, that he had conceived a dislike
to herself, and for the first time began to dread the result
should he know that she was his daughter-in-law. Disinheritance
of Everard might follow, and then farewell
to her dream of wealth, and luxury, and position. It is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>true the latter would be hers to a certain extent, for the
wife of Everard Forrest would always take precedence
of Josephine Fleming, but Josey liked what money would
bring her better than position, and perhaps it would be
well to keep quiet a while longer, provided her rapidly
increasing wants were supplied. In this conclusion she
was greatly strengthened when, the morning following
the reception, Everard came for a few moments to see
her and escort her to the train, for she was to leave that
morning for home.</p>

<p class='c011'>Between Everard and his father there had been a
little conversation concerning Miss Josey, and not very
complimentary to her either.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who was that bold, brazen-faced girl you introduced
to me?” the judge had asked, and Everard replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you mean that blonde in white? That is Miss
Fleming from Holburton. She is called very beautiful.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Umph! looks well enough, for that matter, but I do
not like her. She is quite too forward, and familiar,
and affected. There’s nothing real about her, but her
brass and vulgarity. And you boarded there, it seems,
and knew her well?” the judge said, testily, and Everard
stammered out that he did board with Mrs. Fleming,
and had found Josephine a very agreeable young lady.</p>

<p class='c011'>He must say so much in defense of the girl who was
his wife, but it seemed to vex his father, who began to
lose his temper, and said he should think very little of a
young man who could find anything agreeable in <em>that</em>
girl!</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, she’s no modesty or womanly delicacy at all,
or she would not try to attract as she does with her eyes,
and her hands, and her fan, and her naked arms, and the
Lord only knows what. You are no son of mine if you
can find pleasure in the society of such women as she
represents. Why, she is as unlike Beatrice and Rossie
as darkness is unlike daylight.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This was the judge’s verdict, and Everard felt his
chain cutting deeper and deeper as he thought how impossible
it was for him to acknowledge the marriage now.
He did not sleep at all that night, and the morning found
him pale, and haggard, and spiritless, as he walked down
the road in the direction of Mrs. Everts’. Josey was
waiting for him and ready for the train. She had not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>told any of her numerous admirers that she expected to
leave that morning, as she wished to see Everard alone.
She was neither pale, nor fagged, nor tired-looking,
though she, too, had passed a sleepless night, but her
complexion was just as soft, and creamy, and smooth,
and her eyes just as bright and melting as she welcomed
her husband, and laying her hand on his, said to him:
“You are going with your father, I suppose. How
long before I can come too?”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a sudden lifting of his hand to his head
as if he had been struck, and Everard staggered a little
back from her, as he replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come to Forrest House? I don’t know. I am
afraid that will never be while father lives.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I saw he took a great dislike to me, and probably
he has been airing his opinion of me to you,” she
said, tartly; then, as Everard did not speak, she continued:
“Tell me what he said of me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why should he say anything of you to me? He
knows nothing,” Everard asked, and Josephine replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t know why. I only know he has; so, out
with it. I insist upon knowing the worst. What did
he say?”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a hard ring in her voice, which Agnes knew
well, but which Everard had never heard before, and a
look in her eyes before which he quailed; and after a
moment, during which she twice repeated:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Tell me what he said,” he answered her:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I would rather not, for I have no wish to wound
you unnecessarily, and what father said was not complimentary.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know that. I knew he hated me, but I insist upon
knowing just what he said and all he said,” Josie cried
passionately, for she, who seldom lost her temper except
with Agnes, was beginning to lose it now.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you will insist I must tell you, I suppose,”
Everard said, “but remember that father’s prejudices are
sometimes unfounded.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He meant to soften it to her as much as possible, but
he told her the truth, and Josie was <em>conscious</em> of a
keener pang of mortification than she had ever felt before.
She had meant to win the judge, just as she
won all men when she tried, but she had failed utterly.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>He disliked and despised her, and if he knew she was his
son’s wife he might go to any length to be rid of her,
even to the attempting a divorce. Once, when sorely
pressed, Agnes had suggested that idea as something
which might occur to Everard, and said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“You know that under the circumstances he could
get one easily.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Josephine knew that he could, too, but she had faith
in Everard. He would not bring this publicity upon
himself and her; but his father was quite another sort of
person. She was afraid of him, and of what he might
do if roused to action as a knowledge of the marriage
would rouse him. He must not know of it at present,
and though she had intended to make Everard acknowledge
her as soon as he was graduated and settled at
home she changed her mind suddenly, and was almost
as anxious to keep the secret as Everard himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am greatly obliged to your father for his opinion
of me,” she said, when she could command herself to
speak. “He is the first man I ever failed to please when
I really tried to do so, and I did try hard to make an impression,
but it was all a waste of words; he is drier
and stiffer than an old powder-horn. I don’t like your
father, Everard, and I am free to say so, though, of
course, I mean no blame to you. I am glad I have met
him, for I understand the situation perfectly, and know
just how you shrink from letting him know our secret.
I hoped that you would take me home as soon as you
were settled at your law studies in your father’s office,
but I am convinced that to announce your marriage with
me at present would be disastrous to your future; so we
must wait still longer, hoping that something will <em>turn
up</em>.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She spoke very cheerfully, and her hand was on
Everard’s, and her eyes were wearing their sweetest expression
as she added:</p>

<p class='c011'>“But you <em>will</em> write to me often, won’t you, and try
to love me again as you did before that night, which I
wish had never been for your sake, because I know you
are sorry.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He did not say he was not; he did not say anything,
but the shadow lifted from his face, and his heart
gave a great bound when he heard from her own lips
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>that she should not urge her claim upon him at once.
He had feared this with such fear as a freed slave has of
a return to his chains, and now that he was to have a
little longer respite, he felt so happy and grateful
withal that when she said to him:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wish you’d kiss me once for the sake of the
old time;” he stooped and kissed her twice, and let
her golden head rest against his bosom, where she
laid it for a moment, but he felt no throb of love for this
woman who was his wife. That was dead, and he could
not rekindle it, but he could be kind to her, and do his
duty to her, and he talked with her of his future, and
said he meant to go to work at something at once, and
hoped to become a regular contributor to a magazine
which paid well, and he seemed so bright and cheerful
that Josey flattered herself that she had touched him
again. Nothing could have been farther from the truth,
though he was very polite to her and went with her to
the station, where she was immediately surrounded by a
bevy of students who were there also to take the train,
and who, in their eagerness to serve her, left Everard far
in the background.</p>

<p class='c011'>The fact that young Forrest, who, from the fastest,
wildest young man in college had become the soberest,
most reserved, and, as they fancied, most aristocratic
member of his class, had attended Miss Fleming to the
train, did not in the least lessen her in the estimation of
the students who gathered round her so thickly. Indeed,
it increased her importance, and she knew it, and felt a
great pride in the tall, handsome, dignified man who
stood and saw one take her satchel, another her shawl,
and another her umbrella, while he who alone had a right
to render her these attentions looked on silently. Whatever
he thought he gave no sign, and his face was just
as grave as ever when at last he said good-by, and walked
away.</p>

<hr class='c014'>

<p class='c011'>“Did you come up here to see that girl off?” was said
close to his ear, in a voice and tone he knew so well, just
as he left the depot, and turning suddenly, he saw his
father, with an unmistakable look of displeasure on his
face.</p>

<p class='c011'>The judge was taking his morning stroll, and had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>sauntered to the station just in time to see the long curls
he remembered so well float out of the car window, and
to see the fluttering of the handkerchief Josephine was
waving at his son.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, father, I came to see her off. There was no
one else to do it, and I know her so well; her mother
was very kind to me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Umph! I’ve no doubt of it. Such people always
are kind to young men like you,” the judge said, contemptuously;
“but I won’t have it; I tell you, I won’t!
That girl is just as full of tricks as she can hold, and is
never so happy as when she has twenty or more fools
dangling after her. She will marry the one with the
most money, of course, but it must not be you; remember
that. I believe I’d turn you out of doors.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Just then they met one of the professors, and that
changed the conversation, which did not particularly
tend to raise Everard’s spirits, as he went to the house
where Beatrice and Rosamond were stopping. Still, he
felt a great burden gone when he remembered that of
her own free will Josephine had decided that their secret
must be kept for a while longer, and something of his own
self came back to him as he thought of months, if not a
whole year of freedom, with Beatrice and Rossie, at the
old home in Rothsay.</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
Of the every-day lives of the three young people,
Beatrice, Everard, and Rosamond, I
wish to say a few words before hurrying on
to the tragedy which cast so dark a shadow
over them all. But there was no sign of the
storm now in the rose-tinted sky, and Everard never
forgot that bright summer and autumn which followed
his return from college,—when he was so happy in the
society of Beatrice and Rossie. It is true he never
forgot that he was bound fast, with no hope of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>ever being free, but here in Rothsay, miles and miles
away from the chain which bound him, it did not hurt
so much or seem quite so hard to bear.</p>

<p class='c011'>Josephine was not very troublesome; in fact, she had
only written to him twice, and then she did not ask for
money, and seemed quite as anxious as himself that their
secret should be kept from his father until some way was
found to reconcile him to it. Possibly her reticence on
the subject of money arose from the fact that he sent
her fifty dollars in his first letter written after his return
to Rothsay. This large sum he had got together by the
most rigid economy in his own expenses, and by the interest
on a few shares of railroad stock which a relative
had left to him as her godson. This stock for a time had
been good for nothing, but recently it had risen in value,
so that a dividend had been declared, and Everard had
sent the first proceeds to Josephine; but his boyish love
was dead, and he did not try to resuscitate it, or build
another love where that had been; he was content with
the present as it was. His father, who was very kind to
him, and seemed trying to make amends for his former
severity and harshness, had said he was not to enter
the office to study until October. Looking in his boy’s
face, he had seen something which he mistook for weariness,
and too close application to books, and he said,
“You do not seem quite well. Your mother’s family
were not strong; so rest till October. Have a good time
with Rossie and Bee, and you will be better fitted to
bone down to work when the time for it comes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This was a great deal for Judge Forrest to say, but
he felt very indulgent toward his son, who had graduated
with so much honor, and who seemed to be wholly
upright and steady; and in a fit of wonderful generosity
he went so far as to present him with a fine mustang, as
a fitting match to Beatrice’s fleet riding-horse. This
was just what Everard wanted, and he and Miss Belknap
rode miles and miles together over the fine roads and
through the beautiful country in the vicinity of Rothsay.
Rosamond sometimes accompanied them, but she was
not fond of riding, and old Bobtail, the gray mare, sent
her up so high, and seemed so out of place beside Bee’s
shining black pony, and Everard’s white-faced mustang,
that she preferred remaining at home; and so the two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>were left to themselves, and people talked knowingly of
what was sure to be, and hinted it to Rosamond, who
never contradicted them, but by her manner gave credence
to the story. She believed implicitly that Beatrice was
coming to be mistress of the Forrest House, and was
very happy in the prospect, for next to Mr. Everard she
liked Bee Belknap better than any person in the world.
Many were the castles she built of the time when Everard
should bring his bride home. Since Mrs. Forrest’s
death so many rooms had been shut up, and the house
had seemed so lonely and almost dreary, especially in the
winter, but with Bee there all would be changed, and
Rossie even indulged in the hope that possibly the furniture
in her own little room might be replaced by better,
or at least added to. The judge, too, watched matters
with an immense amount of satisfaction. Years ago
he had settled it that Everard would marry Bee,
and he was sure of it now. That girl with the
yellow hair, as he always called Josephine to himself,
was not anything to his son, as he had once feared she
might be. Everard could never stoop to her; Everard
would marry Bee, and it might as well take place at once;
there was no need to wait, and just as soon as his son
was established in the office he meant to speak to him,
and if it were not already settled it should be, and
Christmas was the time fixed in his own mind as a fitting
season for the bridal festivities. He would fill the house
with guests all through the holidays, and when they were
gone the young couple might journey as far as Washington,
or even Florida, if they liked. Then in the
spring Bee could fit up the south side of the house as
expensively as she chose, and Rossie should have the
large corner room next his own on the north side, thus
leaving the newly-married pair as much to themselves
as possible.</p>

<p class='c011'>And so the wires were being laid, and Everard stepped
over and around them all unconsciously, and took the
goods the gods provided for him, whether in the shape
of Beatrice, or Rosamond, or his father’s uniform kindness
toward him; and the September days went by, and
October came, and found him a student at last in his
father’s office, where he bent every energy to mastering
the law and gaining his profession. There were no more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>long rides with Beatrice, and his mustang chafed and
fretted and grew unmanageable for want of exercise.
There were no more strolls in the leafy woods with Rossie,
who gathered the nuts, and ferns and grasses alone, and
rarely had Everard’s society except at meal-time, when
she managed to post him with regard to all the details
of her quiet, every-day life. She was reading Chateaubriand’s
“Atala” in French, and found it rather stupid;
or she was learning a new piece of music she knew he
would like; or old Blue had six new kittens in his trunk
up in the garret, and she wished him to go and see them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Everard was always interested in what interested
Rosamond, and on no one did his glance rest so kindly
as on this little old-fashioned girl, in whom there seemed
to be no guile; but he had no leisure time to give her.
It was his plan to get his profession as soon as possible,
and then, taking Josephine, go to some new place in the
far West, where he could grow up with the town, and
perhaps be comparatively independent and happy. But
his future had been ordered otherwise, and suddenly,
without a note of warning, his house of cards came
down, and buried him in its ruins.</p>

  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/di_111.jpg' width='100' alt=''>
</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
Everard had been in his father’s office five
weeks or more, when, on a rainy morning
early in November, just as he was settling
himself to his books, and congratulating
himself upon the luxury of a quiet day, his
father came in, and after looking over the paper, and
poking the fire vigorously, seated himself opposite his
son, and began:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Everard, put down your book; I want to talk with
you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, sir,” Everard replied, closing the book and facing
his father with an unaccountable dread that something
unpleasant was coming.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>“It’s never my way to beat round the bush,” the
judge began; “I come to the point at once, and so I want
to know if you and Bee have settled it yet?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Settled what?” Everard asked; and his father replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t be a fool and put on girlish airs. Marrying
is as much a matter of business as anything else, and we
may discuss it just the same. You don’t suppose me in
my dotage, that I have not seen what is in everybody’s
mouth,—your devotion to Beatrice and her readiness to
receive it; wait till I’m through,” he continued, authoritatively,
as he saw Everard about to speak. “I like the
girl; have always liked her, though she is a wild, saucy
thing, but that will correct itself in time. Your mother
believed in her fully, and she knew what was in women.
She hoped you would marry Bee some day, and what I
wish to say is this: you may think you must wait till
you get your profession, but there is no need of that at
all. You are twenty-two. You have matured wonderfully
the last two years, and I may say improved, too;
time was when I could hardly speak peaceably of you
for the scrapes you were eternally getting into, but you
dropped all that after your poor mother died. I was
proud of you at Commencement. I am proud of you
now, and I want you to marry at once. The house needs
a mistress, and I have fixed upon Christmas as the proper
time for the wedding, so if you have not settled it with
Bee, do so at once.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But, father,” Everard gasped, with a face as white
as snow, “it is impossible that I should marry Beatrice.
I have never for a moment considered such a thing.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The deuce you haven’t,” the judge exclaimed, beginning
to get angry. “Pray, let me ask you why you
have been racing and chasing after her ever since you
came home, if you never considered the thing, as you
say? Others have considered it, if you have not. Everybody
thinks you are to marry her, and, by George, I
won’t have her compromised. No, I won’t! She could
sue you for breach of promise, and recover, too, with all
this dancing, and prancing, and scurripping round the
country. If you have not thought of it, you must think
of it now. You surely like the girl.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He stopped to take breath, and Everard answered him:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>“Yes, father, I like her very much, but not in that
way,—not as a wife, and I never can. It is impossible.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why impossible? What do you mean?” the judge
said, loudly and angrily. “Is there somebody else?
Is it that yellow-haired hussy who made those eyes at
me, because, if it is, by Jove, you are no son of mine,
and you may as well understand it first as last. I’ll never
sanction that, never! Why don’t you answer me, and
not stare at me so like an idiot? Do you like that
white-livered woman better than Beatrice? Do you
think her a fitter wife for you and companion for Rosamond?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Everard had opened his lips to tell the truth, but
what his father said of Josephine sealed them tight; but
he answered his father’s last questions, and said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, I do not think her a fitter companion for Rossie
than Beatrice, and I do not like her better.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then what in thunder is in the way?” the judge
asked, slightly appeased. “Have you any fears of Bee’s
saying no? I can assure you there. I know she won’t.
I am as certain of it as that I am living now.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Suddenly there shot across Everard’s mind a way of
escape from the difficulty, a chance for a longer respite,
and he said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“If I were to ask Bee to marry me and she refused
would you be satisfied?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“With you? Yes, but, I tell you she won’t refuse.
And don’t you ask her unless you intend to stick to
it like a man,” the judge replied, as he rose to end the
conference.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I shall ask her, and to-night,” was Everard’s low-spoken
answer, which reached his father’s ears, and sent
him home in a better frame of mind.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was very gracious to Everard at dinner, and paid
him the compliment of consulting him on some business
matter, but Everard was too much pre-occupied to heed
what he was saying, and declining the dessert excused
himself from the table, and went to his own room.</p>

<p class='c011'>Never since his ill-starred marriage had he felt so
troubled and perplexed as now, when the fruit of his
wrong-doing was staring him so broadly in the face. That
his father would never leave him in peace until he proposed
to Beatrice, he knew, and unless he confessed everything
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>and threw himself upon his mercy, there was but one
course left him to pursue,—tell Beatrice the whole
story, without the slightest prevarication, and then
go through the farce of offering himself to her, who
must, of course, refuse. This refusal he could report to
his father, who would not blame him, and so a longer
probation would come to himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>In his excitement he did not stop to consider what a
cowardly thing it was to throw the responsibility upon
a girl, and make her bear the burden for him. To do
him justice, however, he did not for a moment suppose
Beatrice cared for him as his father believed she did, or
he would never have gone to insult her with an offer she
could not accept.</p>

<p class='c011'>He knew she was beautiful and sweet, and all that
was lovely and desirable in womanhood, but she was not
for him. She, nor any one like her, could ever be his
wife. He had made that impossible; had by his own
act put such as she far out of his reach. But when
he reached Elm Park and saw her, so graceful and lady-like,
and heard the well-bred tones of her voice, and
remembered how pure and good she was, there did come
to him the thought that if there was no Josephine in the
way, he might in time have come to say in earnest to
this true, spotless girl what now was but a cruel jest, if
she cared for him,—which she did not in the way his
father believed she did;—he was her friend, her
brother. The Feejee missionary, whose name she saw so
often in the papers, and who had recently been removed
to a more eligible field, had never been quite forgotten,
though there was nothing left to her now of him except
a faded pond-lily, given the day she told him no, and
with his kiss, the first and last, upon her forehead, sent
him away to the girl among the Vermont hills, with the
glasses and the brown alpaca dress. She had no suspicion
of the nature of his errand, and was surprised when,
as if anxious to have it off his mind, he began, impulsively:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Beatrice, I have come to say something serious to
you to-night, and I want you to stop jesting and be as
much in earnest as I am, for I,—I am terribly in earnest
for once in my life. Bee,—I,—I feel as if I were going
to be hung and do the deed myself.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>But his face was white as marble, and his voice shook
as he continued:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am going to tell you something,—going to ask
you something,—going to ask you to be my wife, but
you must refuse.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was an odd way of putting it, and not at all what
Everard had intended to do. He meant to tell her first
and offer himself afterward as a mere form, but in his
agitation and excitement he had just reversed it,—had
told her he was there to ask her to marry him, and she
must tell him no! and a look of scorn sprang to her
eyes as she drew back from him and said, “You presume
much on my good nature, when you tell me in one
instant that you propose asking me to be your wife, and
next that I must refuse you if you do. What reason
have you to think I would accept you, pray?”</p>

<p class='c011'>He knew she was indignant, and justly so, and he answered
her with such a pleading pathos in his voice as
disarmed her at once of her wrath.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t be angry with me, Bee. I have commenced
all wrong. I believe my mind is not quite straight. I
did not come to insult you. I came because I must
come. I want you for a friend, such as I have not in
all the world. I want your advice and sympathy. I
want,—oh, I am the most wretched person living!”</p>

<p class='c011'>And he seated himself upon the sofa, and sat with his
face buried in his hands, while Beatrice stood looking at
him a moment; then, going forward she laid her hand
softly on his head, and said, “What is it, Everard?
What is it you wish to tell me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Without looking up he answered her:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Bee, I wish I were dead! Sit down beside me
and listen to all I have to tell.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She sat down beside him, and listened intently to the
story Everard told her in full, concealing nothing where
he was concerned, but shielding Josephine as far as was
possible. Rosamond’s noble sacrifice of her hair was explained,
and her mistake about Joe Fleming, who in her
imagination still existed somewhere in whiskers and tall
boots, and was the evil genius of Everard’s life. Here
Beatrice laughed merrily once, then questioned Everard
rapidly with regard to every particular of his marriage,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>and the family, and the girl. Where was she now and
what was she like?</p>

<p class='c011'>“You have seen the picture, Bee,” he said. “I
showed it to you that day I broke my head, two years
ago, and you said she looked as if she might wear cotton
lace, while mother, to whom I showed it, too, hinted at
dollar jewelry, and Rossie said she looked as if she were
a sham.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Here Everard laughed himself, but there was more
of bitterness than mirth in it, and Beatrice laughed, too,
as she said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“That was rather hard;—cotton lace, dollar jewelry,
and a sham, though, after all, Rossie’s criticism was
really of the most consequence, if true; perhaps it is not.
Have you her picture now?”</p>

<p class='c011'>He passed it to her, and with a shrewd woman’s intuition,
quickened by actual knowledge, Beatrice felt
that it was true, and her first womanly instinct was to
help and comfort this man who had brought his secret
to her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ned,” she said to him, and the name, now so seldom
used, took her back to the days when she first came from
France and played and quarreled with him. It made her
altogether his sister, and as such she spoke. “Ned, I
am so sorry for you; sorrier than I can express, and I
want to help you some way, and I think it must be
through Josephine. She is your wife, and by your own
showing you were quite as much in fault as she.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, quite,” and Everard shivered a little, for he
guessed what was coming.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, then,” Beatrice went on, “ought you not to
make the best of it? You took her for better or worse,
knowing what you were doing. You loved her then.
Can you not do so again? Is it not your duty to try?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Bee, you do not know, you do not understand.
She is not like you, nor Rossie, nor mother.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, try to make her like us, then,” Beatrice replied.
“If her surroundings are not such as please you,
remove her from them at once. Recognize her as your
wife. Bring her home to Forrest House and I will stand
her friend to the death.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Everard knew that Bee meant what she said, and that
her influence was worth more than that of the whole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>town, and if he could have felt any love or even desire
for Josephine, it would have seemed easy to acknowledge
his marriage, with Bee’s hopeful words in his ear and
Bee’s strong nature to back him, but he did not. He
had no love, no desire for her; he was happier away from
her, happier to live his present life with Beatrice and
Rossie; and, besides that, he could not bring her home;
his father would never permit it, and would probably
turn him from the door if he knew of the alliance. This
Bee did not know, but he told her of the great aversion
his father had conceived for the girl whom he stigmatized
as the yellow-haired hussy from Massachusetts,
“and after that, do you think I can tell him?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It will be hard, I know,” Beatrice replied, “but it
seems your only course, if he insists upon your marrying
me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But if I tell him you refused me, it may make a
difference, and things can go on as they are until I get
my profession,” Everard pleaded, with a shrinking
which he knew was cowardly from all which the telling
his father might involve.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Even then you are but putting off the evil day, and
a thing concealed grows worse as time goes on,” Bee
said. “You must confess it some time, and why not do
it now. At the most your father can but turn you from
his door, and if he does that take your wife and go somewhere
else. You are young, and the world is all before
you, and if there is any true womanhood in Josephine,
it will assert itself when she knows all you have lost for
her. She will grow to your standard. She has a sweet,
childish face, and must have a loving, affectionate
nature. Give her a chance, Everard, to show what she
is.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This giving her a chance was just what Everard
dreaded the most. So long as his life with Josephine
was in the future, he could be tolerably content, and
even happy, but when it looked him square in the face,
as something which must be met, he shrank from meeting
it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I cannot do that, at least, not yet,” he said.
“It will hamper me so in my studies. I cannot tell
father, and bear the storm sure to follow. Josephine
must stay where she is till I see what I can do.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>“But is that best for her?” Beatrice asked. “What
sort of a woman is her mother? She may be a lady, and
still be very poor. What is she, Everard?”</p>

<p class='c011'>He had refrained from speaking of Josephine’s antecedents
to Beatrice. He would rather she should not
know all he knew of the family. It would be kinder to
Josephine to spare her so much; but when Beatrice appealed
to him with regard to the mother, he told just
who Mrs. Fleming was.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bee Belknap was a born aristocrat, and some of the
bluest blood of Boston was in her veins. Indeed, she
traced her pedigree back to Miles Standish on her
father’s side, while her mother came straight down from
a Scottish earl, who married the rector’s daughter. She
was proud of her birth, and the training she had received
at home and abroad had tended to increase this pride,
and it was hard for her to understand just how people
like Roxie Fleming could stand on the same social platform
with herself. She knew they did, but she rebelled
against it, and for a moment Josephine’s cause was in
danger of being lost so far as she was concerned. She
had thought of her as probably the daughter of some
poor, but highly respectable farmer, or mechanic, whose
mother took boarders, as many women do to make a little
money, and whose daughters, perhaps, stitched shoes
or made bonnets, as New England girls often do, but
now that she knew the truth she stood for a moment
aghast, and then, her strong, sensible nature asserted itself
and whispered to her, “a man’s a man for a’ that.”
Josephine was no more to blame for the accident of her
birth than was she, Beatrice Belknap, to be praised for
hers. “I’ll stand by her all the same,” she said to herself,
but she did not urge quite so strenuously upon Everard
the necessity of telling his father at once, for she
felt sure the irascible judge would leave no stone unturned
to ascertain who his daughter-in-law was, and that
the ascertaining would result even worse than Everard
feared.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It may be better to keep silent a little longer,” she
said, and meanwhile she’d turn the matter over in her
own mind and see what she could do to help him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But in order to have any peace at home I must tell
father that you refused me,” Everard said, “and I have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>not yet gone through the farce of offering myself, or
you of refusing the offer.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, with the ghost of a smile on his face he arose,
and standing before Beatrice, continued: “Bee, will you
marry me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, Everard, I will not,” was Bee’s reply, as she,
too, rose, and looked at him, with eyes in which the hot
tears gathered swiftly, while there came to her suddenly
a feeling that she had lost something which had been
very dear to her, and that her intercourse with Everard
could never again be just what it had been. It is true,
she had never seriously thought of him as her future
husband, but she knew that others had thought it, and
with his words, “Bee, will you marry me?” it came to
her with a great shock that possibly, under other circumstances,
she might have answered yes. But all that
was over now. He had put a bar between them, and by
neither word nor look must she tempt him to cross it; so,
brushing her tears away with a quick, impatient gesture,
and forcing a merry laugh, which sounded not unlike a
hysterical sob, she said, “What children we are, Everard.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Yes, they were children in one sense, and in another
the man and woman was strong within them, and Everard
saw something in the girl’s eyes which startled him,
and made his heart throb quickly as he, too, thought “<em>it
might have been</em>.” But with the instincts of a noble,
true man he forced the new-born feeling down, and taking
both her hands in his held them while he said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“You must forgive me, Bee, for seeming to insult
you with words which were a mere farce. You have
been my friend,—the best I ever had,—and your friendship
and society are very dear to me, who never knew a
sister’s love. Can I keep them still after showing you
just the craven coward and sneak I am?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, Everard, you may trust me. I will always be
your friend, and your wife’s friend as well,” Beatrice replied,
and then Everard went away, and she was left
alone to think of the story she had heard, and to realize
more and more all she had lost in losing Everard. The
boy, whom she had teased, and ridiculed, and tormented,
and who had likened her to his grandmother, had become
so necessary to her in his fresh young manhood,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>that it was hard to give him up; but Bee was equal to
the emergency, and with a little laugh she said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“On the whole I am glad there is one man whom I
cannot get upon my string, as Aunt Rachel would say;
but that this man should be the boy who I once vowed
should offer himself to me and be refused, or I would
build a church in Omaha, is mortifying to my pride.
He has offered and been refused, and so the church obligation
is null and void. But I must do something as a
memorial of this foolishness, which I never dreamed of
until to-night. I wonder if Sister Rhoda Baker don’t
want something for her church by this time. I’ll go and
see to-morrow, and take her mother to ride. It’s an age
since I gave her an airing, and my purple velvet will
contrast beautifully with her quilted hood and black
shawl.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bee Belknap was a queer compound, and when, next
morning, the distant relative who lived with her as chaperon,
and whom she called Aunt Rachel, said to her:
“What was that Forrest here for so late? I thought
he’d never go,” she answered, readily:</p>

<p class='c011'>“He was here to ask me to marry him, and I refused
him flat.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You refused him! Are you crazy, Beatrice?” Aunt
Rachel exclaimed, putting down her coffee-cup and staring
blankly at the young girl, who replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes. Have you any objections?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Objections! Beatrice Belknap! I thought this
was sure. See if you don’t go through the woods and
take up with a crooked stick at last. Do you know how
old you are?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, auntie. I am twenty-three; just eleven
months and fifteen days older than Everard, and in
seven years more I shall be thirty, and an old maid.
After that, tortures cannot wring my age from me.
Honestly, though, Everard was not badly hurt. He will
recover in time, and maybe marry,—well, marry Rossie;
who knows?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Marry Rossie! That child,—homely as a hedge
fence!” was the indignant reply of Aunt Rachel, who
was not always choice in her selection of language.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Rosamond is fifteen, and growing pretty every
day,” Beatrice retorted, always ready to defend her pet.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>“She has magnificent eyes and hair, and the sweetest
voice I ever heard. Her complexion is clearing up, her
face and figure rounding out, and she will yet be a
beauty, and cast me in the shade, with my crows-feet and
wrinkles; see if she does not; but I cannot afford to quarrel
any longer; I am going to take Widow Ricketts out
to ride, so good-by, auntie, and don’t be sorry that I am
not to leave you yet. You and I will have many years
together, I hope.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She kissed her aunt, and went gayly from the room,
singing as she went. An hour later and she was whirling
along the smooth river road, with the quilted hood
and black shawl of Widow Ricketts, who, unused to
such fast driving, held on to the side of the little phaeton,
sweating like rain with fear, and feeling very glad
when at last she was set down safe and sound at her
daughter’s door without a broken neck.</p>

<p class='c011'>Rhoda’s church was wanting a new furnace, and
Bee’s check for fifty dollars made the heart of the good
Nazarite woman very warm and tender toward the girl
who had once pretended to have the “power,” just for
the fun of the thing! On reaching home Bee found a
note from Everard, which had been left by a boy from
the village, during her absence, and which ran as
follows:</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Bee</span>:—After leaving you last night, I went
to father, who was waiting for me, and goaded me into
telling him <em>everything</em> there was to tell of Josephine.
Of course, he turned me out of doors immediately, and
said I was no longer his son. I might sleep in my room
during the night, but in the morning I must be off. But
I did not sleep there. I couldn’t, with his dreadful language
in my ears. If I had been guilty of murder, he
could not have talked worse to me than he did, or called
me viler names. So I packed a few things in my valise,
and staid in the carriage-house till it was light. Now, I
am writing this to you, and shall have some boy to
deliver it, as I take the first train South. I have given
up law, and shall find something in Cincinnati or Louisville
which will bring me ready money. If you should
wish to communicate with me, direct to the Spencer
House. I shall get my mail there a while, as I know
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>the clerk. Don’t tell Rossie of Josephine. I’d rather
she should not know. God bless her and you, my best
friends in all the world. And so, good-by. I’ve sown
the wind, and am reaping the whirlwind with a vengeance.</p>

It was past eleven when Everard left Elm
Park after his interview with Beatrice, and
nearly half-past when he reached home,
expecting to find the house dark, and the
family in bed. But as he walked slowly up
the avenue, he saw a light in his father’s room, and the
figure of a man walking back and forth, as if impatient
of something.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Can it be he is waiting for me?” he thought, and a
sigh escaped him as he felt how unequal he was to a conflict
with his father that night.</p>

<p class='c011'>Entering the hall as noiselessly as possible he groped
his way up stairs to the broad landing, when the darkness
was suddenly broken by a flood of light which
poured from Rossie’s room, and Rossie herself appeared
in the door, holding her gray flannel dressing-gown
together with one hand, and with the other shedding her
hair back from her face, which looked tired and sleepy,
as she said: “Oh, I’m so glad you’ve come. Your father
wants to see you, and asked me to sit up and tell you
when you came. Good-night!” and she stepped back
into her room, while he passed slowly down the hall, and
she saw him knock at his father’s room at the far end of
the passage.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, my son, so you’ve come at last,” the judge
said to him, but there was no anger in his voice, only a
slight tone of irritation that he had been kept up so late.
“You have been to see Bee, I take it, and, from the
length of time you staid, conclude that you settled the
little matter we were talking about this morning.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>“Yes, father, we settled it,” Everard said, but his
voice was not the voice of a hopeful, happy lover, and
his father looked suspiciously at him as he continued:</p>

<p class='c011'>“With what result?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Beatrice refused me;” and Everard’s voice was still
lower and more hopeless.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Refused you! ’Tis false! You never asked her!”
the judge exclaimed, growing angry at once.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Father!” and now Everard looked straight in his
sire’s face, “do you mean to say I lie, and I your son
and mother’s?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The judge knew that in times past Everard had been
guilty of almost everything a fast young man ever is guilty
of, but he had never detected him in a falsehood, and he
was obliged to answer him now:</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, not exactly <em>lie</em>, though I don’t understand why
she should refuse you. If I know anything about girls
she is not averse to you, and here you come and tell me
that she refused you flat. There’s some trick somewhere;
something I do not understand. Beatrice likes
you well enough to marry you, and you know it. Why
then did she refuse you, unless you made a bungle of the
whole thing, and showed her you were not more than
half in earnest, as upon my soul I believe you are not;
but you shall be. I’ve had my mind on that marriage
for years, and I will not easily give it up. Do you hear
or care for what I am saying?” he asked, in a voice
growing each instant louder and more excited.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, father,” Everard answered wearily, with the
air of one who did not really comprehend. “I hear,—I
care,—but I am so tired to-night. Let me off, won’t
you, till another time, when I can talk with you better
and tell you all I feel.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, I won’t let you off,” the judge replied. “I
intend to know why you are so indifferent to Bee. Is it,
as I have suspected, that yellow-haired woman? Because
if it is, by the lord Harry, you will be sorry! She shall
never come here; never! The bold-faced, vulgar
thing!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Father!” and Everard roused himself at last, “you
must not speak so of Josephine. I will not listen to it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>That was the speech which fired the train, and the
judge grew purple with rage as he demanded by what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>right his son forbade him to speak as he pleased of Josephine.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is she to you?” he asked, and with white,
quivering lips Everard answered back:</p>

<p class='c011'>“<em>She is my wife!</em>”</p>

<p class='c011'>The words were spoken almost in a whisper, but they
echoed like thunder through the room, and seemed to
repeat themselves over and over again during the moment
of utter silence which ensued. Everard had told his
secret, and felt better already, as if the worst was over;
while his father stood motionless and dumb, glaring upon
him with a baleful light in his eyes, which boded no
good to the sorely-pressed young man, who was the first
to speak.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Let me tell you all about it,” he said, “and then
you may kill me if you choose; it does not matter
much.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, tell me;” his father said, hoarsely; and without
lifting up his bowed head, or raising his voice, which
was strangely sad and low, Everard told his story,—every
word of it, even to Josephine’s parentage and
Rossie’s generous conduct in his behalf.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of Josephine herself he said as little as possible, and
did not by the slightest word hint at his growing aversion
for her. That would not help matters now. She
was his wife, and he called her so two or three times, and
did not see how at the mention of that name his father
ground his teeth together and clutched at his cravat as
if to tear it off, and give himself more room to breathe.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have told you everything now, father,” Everard
said in conclusion, “everything there is to tell, except
that since that night I have not committed a single act
of which I am not willing you should know. I have
tried to do my best, as I promised mother I would the
last time I talked with her. She believed in me then;
she would forgive me if she were here, and for her sake
I ask you to forgive me too. I am so sorry,—sorrier
than you can possibly be. Will you forgive me for
mother’s sake?”</p>

<p class='c011'>He had made his plea and waited for the answer.
He knew how ungovernable his father’s temper was at
times, but it was so long since he had met it in its worst
form that he was wholly unprepared for the terrible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>burst of passion to which his father gave vent. He had
listened quietly to his son’s story, without comment or
interruption, but his anger had grown stronger and fiercer
with each detail, so that even the mention of his dead
wife had no power to move him now. On the contrary,
it exasperated him the more, and, at Everard’s appeal
for pardon, the storm burst and he began in a voice of
such withering scorn and contempt that Everard looked
wonderingly at the old man, who shook with rage and
whose face was livid in spots. There was nothing to be
hoped for from him, and Everard bowed his head again,
while the tempest raged on.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Forgive you for your mother’s sake! Dastard!
How dare you cringe and creep behind her name, when
you have disgraced her in her coffin? Forgive you?
Never! So long as I have sense and reason left!”</p>

<p class='c011'>This was the preface to what followed, for, taking
up the case as a lawyer takes up the case of the criminal
whom it is his duty to prosecute, the judge went
through it step by step, speaking first of the puling
weakness which would allow one to fall into the damnable
trap set for him by a crafty, designing woman, then
of the base hypocrisy, the living lie of years, the systematic
deception, the mean cowardice, the sneaking,
contemptible spirit which would even take money from
a child to squander on that yellow-haired Jezebel, the
insult to Beatrice, asking her to marry him just for a
farce, and lastly, the audacity in thinking such enormities
could be forgiven.</p>

<p class='c011'>Everard did not think they could by the time his case
was summed up. He did not think of much of anything,
he was so benumbed and bewildered, and his father’s
voice sounded like some great roaring river very far
away.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Forgive you!” it said again, with all the concentrated
bitterness of hatred. “Forgive you! Never, so
long as I live, will I forgive or own you for my son, or
in any way recognize that jade as your wife. From this
time on you are none of mine. I disown you. I cast
you off, forever. You may sleep here to-night, but in
the morning you leave, and go back to your darling and
her high-born family, but you’ll never cross my threshold
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>again while I am living. Do you hear, or are you a
stone, a clod, that you sit there so quietly?”</p>

<p class='c011'>His son’s demeanor exasperated him, and he would
have been better pleased had Everard fought him inch
by inch, and given him back scorn for scorn. But this
Everard could not do; he was too completely crushed to
offer a word in his own defense. Only at the last, when
he heard himself disowned, he roused and said, “Do you
mean it, father? Mean to turn me from your house?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mean it? Yes; don’t you understand plain language
when you hear it?” thundered the judge.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, father, I understand, and I will go,” Everard
said, rising slowly, as if it were painful to move; then,
half staggering to the door, he stopped a moment and
added, “I deserve a great deal, father, but not all you
have given me. You have been too hard with me, and
you will be sorry for it some day. Good-by; I am
going.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Go, then, and never come back,” came like a savage
growl from the infuriated man, and those were the last
words which, ever passed between the father and the son.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good-by, father, I am going.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Go, then, and never come back.”</p>

<p class='c011'>They sounded through the stillness of the night, and
Everard shivered, as he went through the long, dark hall
and up the stairs, where the old clock was striking one,
and where the light from Rossie’s door again shone into
the gloom, and Rossie’s face looked out, pale and scared
this time, for she had heard the judge’s angry voice, and
knew a dreadful battle was in progress. So she wrapped
a shawl about her and waited till it was over, and she
heard Everard coming up the stairs. Then she went to
him, for something told the motherly child that he was
in need of comfort and sympathy, and such crumbs as
she could give she would. But she was not prepared for
the cowed, humiliated look of utter hopelessness, and not
knowing what she was doing, she drew him into her
room, and making him sit down, she took his icy hands
and rubbed and chafed them, while she said, “What is
it, Mr. Everard? Tell me all about it. I heard your
father’s voice so loud and angry that it frightened me,
and I sat up to wait for you and tell you how sorry I am.
What is it?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>Her sympathy was very sweet to Everard, and
touched him so closely that for a moment he was unable
to speak; then he said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I cannot tell you, Rossie, what it is; only that it is
something which dates far back, before mother died,
and father has just found it out, and has turned me from
his door.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Mr. Everard, you must have misunderstood
him; he did not mean that. You are mistaken,” Rossie
cried, in great distress; and Everard replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“When a man calls his son a sneak, a coward, a clod,
a villain, a scoundrel, a scamp, a hypocrite, a liar, there
can be no misunderstanding the language, or what it
means; and father called me all these names, and more,
and said things I never can forget. I deserve a great
deal, but not all this. Oh, if I had died years and years
ago!”</p>

<p class='c011'>His chin quivered and his voice trembled as he talked,
while Rossie’s tears flowed like rain as she stood, not
holding his hands now, but gently stroking the hair of
the head bowed down so low with its load of grief and
shame.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mr. Everard,” she said at last, “has this trouble
anything to do with Joe Fleming?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, everything!” Everard answered, bitterly; and
Rossie continued:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I am so sorry! I hoped you had broken with
him forever. You have been so good and nice, and kept
that pledge so beautifully! How could you have anything
to do with Joe?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I tell you it dates far back,—a hundred years ago,
it seems to me. I got into an awful scrape, from which
I cannot extricate myself,” Everard said, and Rossie
continued:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I see, you did something which Joe knows about,
and so has you in his power, and you have just told your
father.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, that is it, very nearly,” Everard replied.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wish you’d tell me what it is. I ’most know I
could help you; at all events, I could speak to your
father; he is always kind to me, and will listen to reason,
I think,” Rossie said; and then Everard looked up
quickly, and spoke decidedly:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>“Rossie, you must not speak to father for me. I
will not have it. He has taunted me enough with ‘hanging
on to the apron-strings of a little girl;’ that’s what
he said, referring to my having taken money from you;
for you see I told him everything, even to the hair you
sold, and I think that made him more furious than all the
rest. It was a dastardly thing in me, and there must be
no repetition. You must not interfere by so much as a
word; remember that when I am gone, for I am going to
Cincinnati first, and if I find nothing to do there, I shall
go on to Louisville, and possibly farther South. I shall
write to you as soon as I know what I am going to do,—perhaps
before; and, Rossie, among all the pleasant
memories of my old home, the very sweetest will be the
memory of the little girl who always in my sorest need
lightened, if she could not remove, the burden. Hush,
Rossie; don’t cry so for me. I am not worth it,” he
said, as she burst into a passionate fit of weeping.</p>

<p class='c011'>He had risen now and was bending over her and
holding her hands in his, and when he saw her sobbing
thus he wound his arm around her, and drawing her
close to him, tried to quiet and comfort her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t, Rossie, don’t; you unman me entirely, to see
you give way so; I’d rather remember you as the brave
little woman who always controlled herself.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Down over Rossie’s shoulders her unbound hair was
falling, and lifting up one of the wavy tresses, Everard
continued, “I shall be gone in the morning, Rossie, and
I want to take with me a lock of this hair. It will be a
constant reminder of the sacrifice you once made for me,
and keep me from temptation. May I have it, Rossie?”</p>

<p class='c011'>She would have given him her head had he asked for
it, and the lock was soon severed from the rest and laid
in his hand. Holding it to the light he said, “Look
how long, and bright, and even it is. You have beautiful
hair, Rossie.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He meant to divert her mind, but her heart was very
sore, and her face tear-stained and wet as she tied the
hair with a bit of ribbon, and placing it in a paper,
handed it to him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you, Rossie,” he said; “no man ever had a
dearer sister than I, and if I am ever anything, it will be
wholly owing to your influence and Bee’s.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>At the mention of Bee’s name Rossie looked quickly
up, struck with a sudden idea.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Mr. Everard,” she said, “how can you go away
and leave Miss Beatrice? and I thought you and she
would some time be married, and we should all be so
happy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That can never be,” Everard replied; “Beatrice
will not have me; I cannot have her. We settled that
to-night, but are the best of friends, and I esteem her as
one of the noblest girls I ever knew. You may tell her
so if she ever speaks of me after I am gone; tell her
that with you she represents to me all that is purest and
sweetest in womanhood; and now, Rossie, I must say
good-by. It is almost two o’clock.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He took her upturned face between both his hands
and held it a moment, while he looked earnestly into the
clear, bright eyes which met his without a shadow of
consciousness, except the consciousness that he was going
away, and this was his farewell. Then he stooped and
kissed her forehead and said, “God bless you, Rosamond;
be a daughter to my father. You are all the child he
has now.”</p>

<p class='c011'>An hour later and Rosamond had cried herself to
sleep, and did not hear Everard’s cautious footsteps, as,
with his satchel in his hand, he stole down the stairs and
out to the carriage-house, where he passed the few remaining
hours of the November night, feeling that he
was indeed an outcast and a wanderer.</p>

How much or how soundly the judge slept
after that stormy interview with his son, or
whether there came to him any twinges of
regret for all the bitter things he had said,
none ever knew. He prided himself upon
seldom changing his mind, when once it was made up;
and so, perhaps, his temper was still at a boiling pitch
when promptly at his usual hour he descended to the breakfast-room,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>and bade John bring in the coffee and eggs.
His face was very red, and his eyes were blood-shot and
watery, and his hands, which held the morning paper,
trembled so, that John glanced curiously at him as he
brought in the breakfast and arranged it upon the table.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where’s Miss Rosamond and my son? Are they
not ready?” the judge asked a little irritably, for he
required every one to be prompt where he was concerned.</p>

<p class='c011'>His questions were partly answered by the appearance
of Rosamond, who looked as fresh and bright as usual,
as she took her seat at the table and began to pour the
coffee. She had slept soundly, and did not feel the
effects of last night’s excitement, except in a little tremor
of fear and anxiety with regard to Everard. Whatever
happened, she was not to interfere or plead for him. He
had said so expressly, and she must obey, and as she
looked furtively at the inflamed face opposite her, she
felt for the first time in her life a great fear of the man,
who, as Everard did not appear, said angrily, “Go to my
son’s room and see what is keeping him; and tell him I
sent you,” he added, as if that message would necessarily
hasten the laggard young man.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Rossie dropped her spoon and sat shaking in
her chair until the servant came swiftly back, with
wonder and alarm upon his face, saying that his young
master was not there and his bed had not been slept in.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not there! and his bed not slept in! What does
it mean? Where is he, then?” the judge asked, in a
voice that made Rossie tremble even more than the announcement
that Everard was gone.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I dunno, mass’r, where he can be. I know he’s not
thar, an’ I disremember seen’ him since he went out last
night after dinner. Maybe he didn’t come back.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Blockhead, he did come back, and he’s here now,
most likely. I’ll see for myself,” said the judge, as he
started for his son’s room, followed by Rossie and John,
the latter of whom said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very well, mass’r, you see for yourself; he gone
sure, an’ left the bed as Axie fix it for him, an’ lemme
see, yes, shoo nuff, his big satchel gone wid him, and his
odder suit. I shouldn’t wonder if he’s gone away,” the
loquacious negro continued, as he investigated the closet
and room.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>“You black hound,” roared the infuriated judge,
“why should he run away? What had he to run from?
Leave the chamber instantly, before I kick you down
stairs, for giving your opinion.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, mass’r, I’s gwine,” was John’s reply as he disappeared
from the scene, leaving the judge and Rossie
alone.</p>

<p class='c011'>The latter was white as a sheet, and leaned against
the mantel, for she knew now that Everard was really
gone. Her paleness and agitation escaped the judge’s
attention, for just then he picked up from the dressing-table
the few lines that Everard had left for him, and
which read as follows:</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Father</span>:—You have always said your yea was yea,
and your nay nay, and I know you meant it when you
bade me leave your house and never come back again;
so I have taken you at your word, and when you read
this I shall be many miles away from Rothsay. After
what you said to me I cannot even pass the night under
this roof, and shall stay in the carriage-house until time
to take the train. I am sorry for all that has passed,
very sorry, and wish I could undo my part of it, but
cannot, and so it is better for me to go. Good-by,
father.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Your son,        <span class='sc'>Everard</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Notwithstanding the judge’s favorite assertion that
his yea was yea, and his nay nay, it is very possible that
if Everard had not taken him so promptly at his word,—if
he had staid and gone to breakfast as usual and
about his daily avocations, his father would have cooled
down gradually, and come in time to look the matter
over soberly and make the best of it. But Everard had
gone, and the irascible old man broke forth afresh into
invectives against him, denouncing him as a dog, to
sleep in carriage-houses, and then run away as if there
was anything to run from.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll never forgive him,” he said to Rossie, who had
stood silently by, appalled at the storm of passion such
as she had never seen before, until at last, forgetful of
Everard’s charge not to interfere, she roused in his defense.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, you will forgive him,” she said. “You must.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>He is your son, and though I don’t know what he has
done to make you so angry, I am sure it is not sufficient
for you to treat him so, and you will send for him to
come back. I know where he’s gone. He came and told
me he was going, though I did not think it would be till
this morning, when I hoped you might make it up.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And so he asked you to intercede for him as you
have been in the habit of doing, and maybe told you the
nice thing he had done?” the judge said, forgetting her
assertion that she did not know.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, sir. Oh, no,” Rossie cried. “He did not ask
me to intercede; he said, on the contrary, that I was on
no account to mention him, and he did not tell me what
it was about, except that it happened long ago; and he
is so sorry and has tried to be good since. You
know he was trying, Judge Forrest, and you will forgive
him, won’t you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“By the lord Harry, no! and you would not ask it if
you knew the disgrace he has brought upon me. I’ll fix
him!” was the judge’s angry reply, as he broke away
from her, and striding down the stairs took his hat
from the hall-stand, and hurried to his office.</p>

<p class='c011'>Great was the consternation among the servants in
the Forrest household when it was known that Mr.
Everard had left the house, and gone no one knew
whither, and many were the whispered surmises as to
the cause of his going.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Some row between him and old mass’r,” John said,
and his solution of the mystery was taken as the correct
one, the negroes all siding with Mr. Everard, who was
very popular with them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Old Axie, the cook, ventured to question Rosamond a
little; but Rossie kept her own counsel, and, returning
to her room, was crying herself sick, when a message
came that Beatrice was asking for her. Immediately
after reading Everard’s note, Beatrice had driven over
to the Forrest House, where she was admitted at once to
Rossie’s room, and heard all that Rossie knew of the
events of the previous night.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Miss Beatrice,” Rossie said, “why did you refuse
him? He told me about it, and I ’most know if
you had said yes it would all have been so different.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bee’s face was scarlet as she replied:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>“He told you that, and nothing more?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, he said something about wouldn’t and couldn’t,—I
don’t know what, for it is all confused to me. I
thought you liked him and he liked you. He said he
did, and he bade me tell you that you were the purest
and sweetest woman in the world, and the best, or something
like that, and I think you ought to marry him, I
do,” and Rossie looked reproachfully at poor Bee, who
was very pale, and whose voice was sad and low as she
said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Rossie, I could not marry Everard if I wished to.
There is an insuperable barrier, and if he did not explain,
I must not. Did he give you any hint as to the
cause of his quarrel with his father?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No,” Rossie replied, “only that it dated far back,
and had something to do with Joe Fleming. I wish
Joe was in Guinea; he is always doing harm to Mr.
Everard.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Beatrice could not forbear a smile at this ludicrous
mistake of sex, and for a moment was tempted to tell
the girl the truth; but remembering that Everard had
said Rossie was not to know, she held her peace, and
Rossie was left in ignorance of Joe’s real identity.</p>

<p class='c011'>After leaving the Forrest House Beatrice drove past
the judge’s office, with a faint hope that she might see
him, and perhaps be of some service to Everard by
speaking for him, should the opportunity occur. It was
years since the judge, who once stood high in his profession,
had done much business, and his office was occupied
by Mr. Russell, his legal adviser; but he was frequently
there, and as Bee drove down the street she saw him
standing outside the door, glancing up and down as if
looking for some one. Something in his attitude or
manner induced her to rein her ponies up to the curbstone,
where she could speak to him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good morning, Judge Forrest,” she said, as naturally
as if in her heart she did not think him a monster of
cruelty. “Were you waiting for me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, not exactly,” and a faint smile appeared on the
dark face. “I was looking for Parker, but maybe you’ll
do as well if you choose to step in and witness my will.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Your will!” Bee replied, and all the blood in her
body seemed surging into her face as she felt intuitively
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>that a will made just now would be disastrous to Everard.
“Have you never made your will before?” she
asked, and he replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Never; but it’s high time I did. Yes, high time!”
and he shook his head defiantly at something invisible.
“Can you go in as well as not?” he continued; and,
summoning all her courage for the conflict, Beatrice said
to him:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am willing to go in, but not to witness any will
which is in any way adverse to Everard.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who said it was adverse to him, the dog? Do you
know how he has disgraced me? but yes, you do; he
said he told you all, and insulted you with an offer, and
now he has run away as a crowning feat. If you can
forgive him, I can’t;” and the judge trembled from head
to foot as he talked of his son to Beatrice, who came
bravely to the rescue, and standing nobly for Everard,
tried to bring his father to reason, and make him say he
would forgive his son and endure the wife because she
was his wife.</p>

<p class='c011'>But she might as well have given her words to the
winds, for any effect they had. The judge was past all
reason, and only grew more and more angry as he talked
of the disgrace which Everard’s marriage had brought
upon his name. Finding that what she said was of no
avail in the judge’s present mood, Beatrice bade him
good morning and drove away, resolving to see him
again as soon as his temper had cooled, and try what she
could do by way of a reconciliation.</p>

<p class='c011'>The next morning breakfast was much later than
usual at Elm Park, for Beatrice had slept but little, and
she was still in bed when her maid brought a message to
her from Rosamond to the effect that she must come at
once to the Forrest House, as the judge had been smitten
suddenly with apoplexy, and was lying in a half unconscious
condition, nearly resembling death. Terrified
beyond measure, Beatrice dressed herself hurriedly, and
was soon on her way to the house, where she found matters
even worse than she feared.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/di_135.jpg' width='100' alt=''>
</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
Breakfast at the Forrest House had been
late that morning, for the judge, who was
usually so prompt, did not make his appearance,
and Rosamond waited for him until the
clock struck eight. Then, as the minute-hand
crept on and he still did not come down, she went to the
door of his room and knocked, but there came no answer,
though she thought she heard a faint sound like the moan
of some one in pain. Knocking still louder, with her
ear to the keyhole, she called, “Judge Forrest, are you
awake? Do you hear me? Do you know how late it
is?”</p>

<p class='c011'>This time there was an effort to reply, and without
waiting for anything further, Rosamond went unhesitatingly
into the room. The shutters were closed and the
heavy curtains drawn, but even in the darkness Rossie
could discern the white, unnatural face upon the pillow,
and the eyes which met hers so appealingly as the judge
tried in vain to speak, for the blue lips gave forth only
an unmeaning sound, which might have meant anything.
There was a loud call for help, and in a moment the
room was full of the terrified servants, who ran over and
against each other in their frantic haste to execute Miss
Rossie’s orders, given so rapidly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Open the shutters and windows wide and let in the
air, and bring some camphor, and hartshorn, and ice-water,
quick, and somebody go for the doctor and Miss
Belknap as soon as they can, and don’t make such a
noise with your crying, it’s only a,—a,—a fit of some
kind; he will soon be better,” Rossie said, with a forced
calmness, as she bent over the helpless man and rubbed
and chafed the hands which, the moment she let go of
them, fell with a thud upon the bed-clothes, where they
lay helpless, nerveless, dead, as it were, to all action or
feeling; and while she rubbed and worked over him and
asked him questions he could not answer, his eyes followed
her constantly, as if with some wish the dumb
lips could not express.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>The doctor was soon there, but a glance at his patient
convinced him that his services were of no avail, except
to make the sufferer a little more comfortable. It was
partly apoplexy, partly paralysis, induced by some great
excitement or over-work, he said to Rosamond, whom he
questioned closely as to the judge’s appearance the previous
night. He had come home about four o’clock,
Rosamond said, and eaten a very hearty dinner, and
drank more wine than usual. She noticed, too, that his
face was very red, and that he smoked a long time after
dinner before he came into the parlor where she was
getting her lessons. He had asked her to play some old-fashioned
tunes, which he liked best, he said, because
they took him back to the time when he was a boy at
home in Carolina. Then he told her of his home and his
mother, and talked of his dead wife, and said he hoped
Forrest House would one day have a mistress as sweet
and good as she was. When at last he said good-night,
he kissed her forehead and said, “My child; you are all
I have left me now. Heaven bless you!” then he went
up stairs, and Rossie knew nothing more till she found
him in the morning.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was no hope; it was merely a matter of a few
days at most, the doctor said; and then he asked where
Everard was, saying, he ought to be sent for. This
was to Beatrice and Rossie both, after the former had
arrived and before she had seen the judge. The two
girls exchanged glances, and Beatrice was the first to
speak.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Everard left home for Cincinnati early yesterday
morning,” she said, “but I know his address, and will
telegraph at once.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very well,” the doctor replied, looking curiously at
her, for he had heard a flying rumor of something wrong
at the Forrest House, which had driven the heir away.</p>

<p class='c011'>Accordingly, a telegram was sent to the Spencer
House, Cincinnati, to the effect that Judge Forrest was
dangerously ill, and Everard must come immediately.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not here, and has not been here,” was the answer
telegraphed back; and then a message went to the Galt
House, in Louisville, where Everard always stopped, but
that too elicited the answer “Not here.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Where was he, then,—the outcast son,—when his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>father lay dying, with that white, scared, troubled look
upon his face, and that vain effort to speak and let his
wishes be known. Dead his body was already, so far as
power to move was concerned, but the mind was apparently
unimpaired, and expressed itself in the agonized
expression of his face, and the entreating, beseeching,
pleading look of the dim eyes which followed Rosamond
so constantly and seemed trying to communicate with her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is something he wants,” Rossie said to Beatrice,
who shared her vigils, “and if I could only guess
what it was;” then, suddenly starting up, she hurried to
his side, and taking the poor, palsied hand in hers rubbed
and caressed it pityingly, and smoothing his thin hair,
said to him, “Judge Forrest, you want something, and I
can’t guess what it is, unless,—unless—;” she hesitated
a moment, for as yet Everard’s name had not been mentioned
in his hearing, and she did not know what the
effect might be; but the eyes, fastened so eagerly upon
her, seemed challenging her to go on, and at last she
said,—“unless it is Mr. Everard. Has it anything to do
with him?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Oh, how hard the lips tried to articulate, but they
only quivered convulsively and gave forth a little moaning
sound, but in the lighting up of the eager eyes,
which grew larger and brighter, Rossie thought she read
the answer, and emboldened by it went on to say that
they had telegraphed to Cincinnati and Louisville both,
and had that morning dispatched a message to Memphis
and New Orleans.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We shall surely find him somewhere,” she continued,
“and he will come at once. I do not think he was
angry with you when he went away, he spoke so kindly
of you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Again the lips tried to speak, but could not; only the
eyes fastened themselves wistfully upon Rosamond, following
her wherever she went, and as if by some subtle
magnetism bringing her back to the bedside, where she
stayed almost constantly. How those wide-open, never-sleeping
eyes haunted and troubled her and made her at
last almost afraid to stay alone with them, and meet their
constant gaze! Beatrice had been taken sick, and was
unable to come to the Forrest House, and the judge
seemed so much more quiet when Rossie was sitting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>where he could look her straight in the face, that the
man hired to nurse him staid mostly in the adjoining
room, and Rossie kept her vigils alone, wearying herself
with the constantly recurring question as to what it was
the sick man wished to tell her. Something, sure, and
something important, too,—for as the days went on, and
there came no tidings of his son, the eyes grew larger,
and seemed at times about to leap from their sockets, to
escape the horror and remorse so plainly written in them.
What was it he wished to say? What was it troubling
the old man so, and forcing out the great drops of sweat
about his lips and forehead, and making his face a wonder
to look upon? Rosamond felt sometimes as if she
should go mad herself sitting by him, with those wild
eyes watching her so intently that if she moved away for
a moment they called her back by their strange power,
and compelled her not only to sit down again by them,
but to look straight into their depths, where the unspeakable
trouble lay struggling to free itself.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Judge Forrest,” Rossie said to him the fifth day
after his attack, “you wish to tell me something and you
cannot, but perhaps I can guess by mentioning ever so
many things. I’ll try, and if you mean no look straight
at me as you are looking now; if you mean yes, turn
your eyes to the window, or shut them, as you choose.
Do you understand me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was the shadow of a smile on the wan face,
and the heavy eyelids closed, in token that he did comprehend.
Rossie knew the judge was dying, that at the
most only a few days more were his, and ought not
some one to tell him? Was it right to let that fierce,
turbulent spirit launch out upon the great sea of eternity
unwarned?</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, if I was only good, I might help him, perhaps,”
she thought; “at any rate he ought to know, and maybe
it would make him kinder toward Everard,” for it was
of him she meant to speak, through this novel channel
of communication between herself and the sick man.</p>

<p class='c011'>She must have the father’s forgiveness with which to
comfort the son, and with death staring him in the face
he would not withhold it; so she said to him:</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are very sick, Judge Forrest; you know that,
don’t you?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>The eyes went slowly to the window and back again,
while she continued in her plain, outspoken way:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you think I ought to tell you if you are going
to die?”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a momentary spasm of terror on the face,
a look such as a child has when shrinking from the rod,
and then the eyes went to the window and back to Rossie,
who said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“We hope for the best, but the case is very bad, and
if you do not see Mr. Everard again shall I tell him you
forgive him, and were sorry?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Quick as lightning the affirmative answer agreed
upon between them was given, and in great delight
Rossie exclaimed, “I am so glad, for that is what you
have tried so hard to tell me. You wish me to say this
to Mr. Everard, and I will. Is that all?”</p>

<p class='c011'>This time the eyes did not move, but looked into hers
with such an earnest, beseeching expression, that she
knew there was more to come. Question after question
followed, but the eyes never left her face, and she could
see the pupils dilate and the color deepen in them, as
they seemed burning themselves into hers.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is it? What can it be?” she asked, despairingly.
“Does it concern Mr. Everard in any way?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” was the eye answer quickly given, and then
Rosamond guessed everything she could think of, the
possible and impossible, but the bright eyes kept their
steady gaze upon her until, thinking of Joe Fleming, she
asked, “Is somebody else concerned in it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” was the response, and not willing to introduce
Joe too soon, Rossie said: “Is it the servants?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is it Beatrice?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is it I?”</p>

<p class='c011'>She had no thought it was, and was astonished when
the eyes went over to the window in token that it was.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is it something that I can do?” she asked, and the
eyes seemed to leap from her face to the window.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And shall I some time know what it is?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Again the emphatic “yes,” while the sweat ran like
rain down his face.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then, Judge Forrest,” and Rossie put on her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>wisest, oldest air, “you may be certain I’ll do it, for I
promise you solemnly that if anything comes to light
which you left undone, and which I can do, I’ll do it,
sure.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The eyes fairly danced now, and there was no mistaking
the joy shining in them, while the lips moved as
if in blessing upon the girl, who took the helpless hand
and found there was a slight pressure of the limp, lifeless
fingers which clung to hers.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is that all? have you made me understand?” she
asked, and he answered yes, and this time his eyes did
not come back to her face, but closed wearily, and in a
few moments he was sleeping quietly, as he had not done
before since his illness.</p>

<p class='c011'>The sleep did him good, and he was far less restless
after he awoke, and there was a more natural look in his
face, but nothing could prolong his life, which hung
upon a thread, and might go out at any time. There
was no more following Rossie with his eyes, though he
wanted her with him constantly, and seemed happier
when she was sitting by him and ministering to his
comfort. Sometimes he seemed to be in a deep reverie,
with his eyes fixed on vacancy, and the great sweat-drops
standing thickly on his face from the intensity of his
thought. Of what was he thinking as he lay there so
helpless? of the wasted years which he could not now reclaim?
of sins committed and unforgiven in the days which
lay behind him? of the wife who had died in that room
and on that very bed? of the son to whom he had been
so harsh and unforgiving, and who was not there now to
cheer the dreary sick room? And did the unknown
future loom up darkly before him and fill his soul with
horror and dread of the world so near to him that he
could almost see the boundary line which divides it
from us?</p>

<p class='c011'>Once, when Rossie said to him, “Shall I read you
something from the Bible?” he answered her with the
affirmative sign, and taking her own little Bible, which
her mother once used, she opened it at the first chapter
of Isaiah, and her eyes chancing to fall upon the 18th
verse, she commenced reading in a clear, sweet voice,
which seemed to linger over the words, “Come now and
let us reason together, saith the Lord; though your sins
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>be as scarlet they shall be white as snow; though they
be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.” There were
spasms of pain distorting the pinched features on the
pillow, as the judge listened to those blessed words of
promise and hope for even the worst of sinners. Scarlet
sins and crimson sins all to be forgiven, and what were
his but these?</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do believe he’s concerned in his mind,” Rossie
thought, as she looked at him; and bending close to him
she whispered, amid her own tears, “Shall I say the
Lord’s Prayer now?”</p>

<p class='c011'>She knew he meant yes, and kneeling by his bedside,
with her face on his hands, she said the prayer he
could not join in audibly, though she was sure he prayed
in his heart; and she wished so much for some one older,
and wiser, and better than herself, to see and talk to
him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Shall I send for the minister or for Mrs. Baker?”
she asked, feeling in that hour that there was something
in the Nazarite woman, fanatical though she might be,
which would answer to the sore need.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the judge wished neither the clergyman nor Mrs.
Baker, then; he would rather that pure young girl should
read to and pray with him, and he made her understand
it, and every day from that time on until the end came,
she sat by him and read, and said the simple prayers of
her childhood, and his as well,—prayers which took him
back to his boyhood and his mother’s knee, and made
him sob sometimes like a little child, as he tried so often
to repeat the one word “forgive.” Gradually there
came a more peaceful expression upon his face; his eyes
lost that look of terror and dread, and the muscles about
his mouth ceased to twitch so painfully, but of the
change within,—if real change there had been,—he could
not speak; that power was gone forever, and he lay,
dead in limb as a stone, waiting for the end.</p>

<p class='c011'>Once Rossie said to him, “Do you feel better, Judge
Forrest, about dying. I mean, are you afraid now?”</p>

<p class='c011'>He looked her steadily in the face and she was sure
his quivering lips said no to her last question. That was
the day he died, and the day when news was received
from Everard. He had returned to Louisville from a
journey to Alabama, had found the telegrams, and was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>hastening home as fast as possible. Beatrice was better,
and able to be again at the Forrest House, but it was
Rossie who took to the dying man the message from his
son. He was lying perfectly quiet, every limb and
muscle composed, and a look of calm restfulness on his
face, which lighted suddenly when Rossie said to him,
“We have heard from Mr. Everard; he is on his way
home; he will be here to-night. You are very glad,”
she continued, as she saw the unmistakable joy in his
face. “Maybe you will be able to make him understand
what it was you wished to have done, but if you cannot
and I ever find it out, depend upon it I will do it, sure.
You can trust me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She looked like one to be trusted, the brave, unselfish
little girl, on whom the dying eyes were fixed, so that
Rossie’s was the last face they ever saw before they
closed forever on the things of this world, and entered
upon the realities of the next. Everard was not there,
for the train was behind time, and when at last the
Forrest House carriage came rapidly up the avenue,
bringing the son who ten days ago had been cast out
from his home and bidden never to enter it again, there
were knots of crape upon the bell-knobs, and in the
chamber above a sheeted figure lay, scarcely more quiet
and still than when bound in the relentless bands of
paralysis, but with death upon the white face, which in
its last sleep looked so calm and peaceful.</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
It was Rosamond who met Everard as he came
into the house, and taking his hands in hers,
held them in token of sympathy, but said no
word by way of condolence, or of the dead
father either. She merely asked him of his
journey and the delay of the train, and if he was not
cold and hungry, and saw that his supper was served
him by a bright, cheerful fire, and made him in all respects
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>as comfortable as she could, while the servants
vied with each other in their attentions to him, for was
he not now their master, the rightful heir of all the Forrest
property. Whether Everard experienced any sense
of freedom and heirship, or not, I cannot tell, or what he
felt when at last he stood by his dead father, and looked
upon the face which, when he saw it last, had been distorted
with passion and hatred of himself. How placid
and even sweet it was in its expression now,—so sweet
that Everard stooped down, kissing the cold forehead,
and whispered softly: “I am so sorry, father, that I
ever made you angry with me;” then, he replaced the
covering and went out from the silent room. In the
hall he met Rossie, who, seeing the trace of weeping on
his face, thought to comfort him by repeating the message
left him by his father.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Would you mind my telling you all about his sickness;
can you bear to hear it?” she asked, and he replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, tell me about it,—from the very first.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So they sat down together, and in her quaint, straightforward
way Rossie told the story of the last ten days,
softening as much as possible the judge’s anger when he
found his son had taken him at his word and gone, and
dwelling the most upon the change which came over
him while lying so helpless and weak. She told of the
method of communication she managed to establish, and
which had been suggested to her by reading Monte Cristo,
and then continued:</p>

<p class='c011'>“He seemed so glad when I told him we had sent for
you, and so sorry that we could not find you, and his eyes
kept following me all the time as if there was something
he wanted to say and couldn’t, and at last I found out
what it was. If he never saw you again, he wished me
to tell you that he forgave you everything; that was it,
I know, and he was so happy and quiet after it, though
he wanted you to come so much.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Here Rossie paused, and thought of that mysterious
thing which had seemed to trouble him the most, and which
she was pledged to do when she found out what it was.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wonder if I ought to tell him that now,” she
thought, and finally concluded that she would not until
something definite came to her knowledge of which she
could speak.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>The next morning Beatrice came over, with a great
pity in her heart for Everard, and a great fear as well,
when she remembered the angry man who had asked
her to witness his will. Had he carried out his purpose
and left behind him a paper which would work mischief
to his son, or had he thought better of it, and destroyed
it, perhaps, or left it unwitnessed? She could not
guess. She could only hope for the best, so far as the
will was concerned; but there was a heavier trouble in
store for the young man than loss of property,—the
acknowledging his marriage and bringing home his wife,
for he would do that now, of course. There was no
other way, and Beatrice resolved at once to stand
bravely by Mrs. J. E. Forrest when she should arrive.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then came the funeral,—a grand affair, with a score
of carriages, a multitude of friends, and crowds of
people, who came to go over the house and through the
grounds more than for any respect they had for the man
who lay in his costly coffin, unmindful of the curious
ones who looked at him and speculated upon the nature
of the trouble which had driven his only son from home.
Everybody knew there had been trouble, and each one
put his or her construction on it, and all exonerated
Everard from more blame than naturally would attach
to the acts of a young man like him, as opposed to the
ideas of a man like his father.</p>

<p class='c011'>Beatrice went with Everard and Rossie to the grave,
and then back to the house, which in their absence had
been cleansed from the atmosphere of death. The windows
and doors had been opened to admit the fresh, pure
air blowing up from the river; then they were closed
again and wood fires kindled on the hearth, and the table
arranged in the dining-room, and one of Aunt Axie’s
best dinners was waiting for such of the friends as chose
to stay.</p>

<p class='c011'>Between Beatrice and Lawyer Russell there had been
a private talk concerning the will which so much troubled
Bee, and the lawyer had inclined to the belief that there
was none of recent date, or he should have known it.
He would look, however, he said, as he had a key to the
judge’s private desk in the office. He had looked, and
to his surprise had found a will, which must have been
made the very day before the judge’s sickness, and during
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>his own absence from the office. This he communicated
to Beatrice, and with her remained at the Forrest
House to dinner for the purpose of making the fact
known to Everard as soon as possible. As for Everard,
he had not thought of a will, or indeed of anything, except
in a confused, general kind of way, that he was, of
course, his father’s natural heir, and that now Josephine
must come there as his wife, and from that he shrank
with a feeling amounting to actual pain; and he was not
a little surprised when, after dinner was over, and they
had returned to the long parlor, Lawyer Russell, as the
old and particular friend of the family, said to him, “I
found in looking over your father’s papers a will, and as
it was inclosed in an envelope directed to me, I took
charge of it, and have it with me now. Shall I read it
aloud, or give it to you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A will!” Everard said, and a deep flush spread itself
over his face as if he dimly felt the coming blow
which was to strike him with such force. “Did father
leave a will? I never supposed he made one. Read it
aloud, of course. These are all my friends,” and he
glanced at the clergyman and his wife, and Beatrice and
Rossie, the only people present.</p>

<p class='c011'>The two girls were sitting side by side on a low sofa,
and opposite them was Everard, looking very pale and
nervous as he bent forward a little to listen to the will.
It was made the day before the judge’s illness, and was
duly drawn up and witnessed by Parker and Merritt, the
two students in the office, and after mentioning a few
thousands which were to be given to different individuals
and charities, the judge went on: “the remainder of
my estate, both real and personal, I give, bequeath, and
devise to the girl, Rosamond Hastings, and——”</p>

<p class='c011'>Lawyer Russell got no further, for there was a low
cry from Rossie as she sprang to her feet, and crossed
swiftly to Everard’s side. He, too, had risen, and with
clasped hands was gazing fixedly at the lawyer, like one
listening to his death-warrant.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What did he say, Mr. Everard, about me? What
does it mean?” Rossie asked, laying both hands on Everard’s
arm, and drawing his attention to herself.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It means that my father disinherited me, and made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>you his heir,” Everard answered her, a little bitterly,
while she continued:</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is not so. It does not read that way. There is
some mistake;” and before the lawyer was aware of her
intention she snatched the paper from him, and ran her
eye with lightning rapidity over what was written on it,
comprehending as she read that what she had heard was
true.</p>

<p class='c011'>Everard was disinherited, and she was the heiress of
all the Forrest estate. Her first impulse was to tear the
paper in pieces, but Everard caught her hands as she
was in the act of rending it asunder, and said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Rossie, you must not do that. The will will stand
just as my father meant it should.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Rossie’s face was a study as she lifted it toward
Everard, pale as death, with a firm, set look about the
mouth, and an expression in her large black eyes such as
the Cenci’s might have worn when upon the rack.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Mr. Everard,” she said, “you must always hate
me, though I’ll never let it stand. I did not know it. I
never dreamed of such a thing. I shall never touch it,
never. Don’t hate me, Mr. Everard. Oh, Beatrice, help
me,—somebody help me. I believe I am going to die.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But she was only fainting, and Everard took her in
his arms and carried her to an open window in the adjoining
room, and giving her to the care of Beatrice,
waited to see the color come back to her face and motion
to her eyelids; then he returned to the parlor, where
Lawyer Russell was examining the document which had
done so much harm and made the memory of the dead
man odious.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Everard, this is a very strange affair; a most inexplicable
thing,” the lawyer said. “I cannot understand
it, or believe he really meant it. I do not wish to pry
into your affairs, but as an old friend of the family, may
I ask if you know of any reason, however slight, why
he should do this?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” Everard answered promptly, “there is a reason;
a good one, many would say; and that I was
rightly punished. The will is just; I have no fault to
find with it. I shall not try to dispute it. The will
must stand.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He spoke proudly and decidedly, with the air of one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>whose mind was made up, and who did not wish to continue
the conversation, and who would not be made an
object of pity or sympathy by any one. But when Lawyer
Russell was gone, and Beatrice came to him as he sat
alone by the dying fire, and putting her hand on his
bowed head, said to him:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am so sorry, and wish I could help you some way,”
he broke down a little, and his voice shook as he replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you, Bee. I know you do, and your friendship
and sympathy are very dear to me now, for you
know everything, and I can talk to you as to no one else.
Father must have been very angry, and his anger reaches
up out of his grave and holds me with a savage grip, but
I do not blame him much, and, Bee, don’t think there is
no sweet with the bitter, for that is not so. It is true I
like money as well as any one, and I do not say that I
had not to some degree anticipated what it would bring
me, but, Bee, with that feeling was another, a shrinking
from what would be my plain duty, if I were master
here. You know what I mean.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You would bring your wife home,” Bee answered,
and he continued:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, that would have to be done, and,—Heaven
forgive me if I am wrong,—but I almost believe I would
rather be poor and work for her,—she living in Holburton,—than
be rich and live with her here. And then, if
I must be supplanted, I am so glad it is by Rossie. She
takes it hard, poor child; how was she when you left
her?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Over the faint, but crying bitterly, and she bade
me tell you to come to her,” Beatrice replied, and Everard
went to Rossie’s room, where she was lying on the
couch, her eyes swollen with weeping, and her face very
pale.</p>

<p class='c011'>She <em>was</em> taking it hard,—her sudden accession to
riches, and when she saw Everard she began sobbing
afresh as if her heart would break.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Please go away,” she said to Beatrice, “I want to
see him alone.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Beatrice complied, and the moment she was gone
Rosamond began to tell Everard how impossible it was
that she should ever touch the money left her in a fit of
anger.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>“It is not mine,” she said. “I have no shadow of
right to it, and you must take it just the same as if that
will had never been. Say you will, or I believe I shall
go mad.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But Everard was as immovable as a rock, and answered
her:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you for a moment think my pride, if nothing
else, would allow me to touch what was willed away
from me? Never, Rossie. I would rather starve; but
I shall not do that. I am young and strong, and the
world is before me, and I am willing to work at whatever
I find to do, and shall do so, too, and make far more
of a man, I dare say, than if I had all this money. I am
naturally indolent and extravagant, and very likely
should fall into my old expensive habits, and I don’t
want to do that. I am so glad you are the heiress; so
glad to have you mistress here in the old home. You
will make a dear little lady of Forrest House.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He spoke almost playfully, hoping thus to soothe and
quiet her, for she was violently agitated, and shook like
a leaf; but nothing he said had any effect upon her.
Only one thing could help her now. She felt that she
had unwittingly been the means of wronging Everard,
and she never could rest until the wrong was righted,
and his own given back to him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll never be the lady of Forrest House,” she said,
energetically. “I shall give it back to you, whether you
will take it or not. It is not mine.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, Rossie, it is yours. He knew what he was
doing; he meant you to have it,” Everard said; and
starting suddenly, as the remembrance of something
flashed upon her, Rossie shed back her hair from her
spotted, tear-stained face, and exclaimed, with a ring of
joy in her voice:</p>

<p class='c011'>“He might have meant it at first, when he was very
angry, but he repented of it and tried to make amends.
I see it now. I know what he meant,—the something
which concerned you, and which I was to do. I promised
solemnly I would,—it will be a dreadful lie if I don’t;
but you will let me when you hear,—when you know how
he took it back.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She was very much excited, and her eyes shone like
stars as she stood before Everard, who looked at her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>curiously, with a thought that her mind might really be
unsettled.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sit down, Rossie, and compose yourself,” he said,
trying to draw her back to the couch; but she would not
sit down, and she went on rapidly:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I told you how I managed to talk with your father,
and to find out that he wanted to forgive you, but I did
not tell you the rest. I thought I’d wait till it came to
me what I was to do, and it <em>has</em> come. I know now just
what he meant. He was not quiet after the forgiveness,
as I thought he’d be, but his eyes followed me everywhere,
and said as plain as eyes could say, ‘There is
something more;’ so I began to question him again,
and found it was about you and another person. That
person was myself, and I was to do something when I
found out what it was. I said, ‘Is it something I am to
do for Mr. Everard?’ and his eyes went to the window;
then I asked, ‘Shall I some day know what it is?’ and
he answered ‘Yes.’ Then I said, ‘I’ll surely, surely do
it,’ and the poor, helpless face laughed up at me, he was
so pleased and happy. After that he was very quiet.
So you know he meant me to give the money back, and
you will not refuse me now?”</p>

<p class='c011'>For a moment Everard could not speak. As Rossie
talked, the great tears had gathered slowly and dropped
upon his face. He could see so vividly the scene which
she described,—the dim, eager eyes of his dead father
trying to communicate with the anxious, excited little
girl, who had, perhaps, interpreted their meaning aright.
There could be but little doubt that his father, when his
passion cooled down, was sorry for the rash act, and
Everard was deeply moved by it, and for a little space
of time felt uncertain how to act, but when he remembered
who must share his fortune with him, and all his
father had said of her, he grew hard and decided again,
and said to Rosamond:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am glad you told me this, Rossie. It makes it
easier to bear, feeling that possibly father was sorry, and
wished to make reparation, but that does not change the
facts, nor the will. He gave everything to you, and you
cannot give it to me now, if you would. You are not
of age, you see.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you mean,” Rosamond asked, “that even if you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>would take the money, I cannot give it back till I am
twenty-one?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not lawfully, no,” Everard replied; and Rossie exclaimed,
almost angrily:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I can; I will. I know there is some way, and I’ll
find it out. I will not have it so, and I think you are
mean to be so proud and stiff.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She was losing all patience with Everard for what
she deemed his obduracy; her head was aching dreadfully,
and after this outburst she sank down again upon
the couch, and burying her face in the pillow told him
to go away and not come again till he could do as she
wished him to do. It was not often that Rosamond was
thus moved, and Everard smiled in spite of himself at
her wrath, but went out and left her alone as she desired.</p>

She looked like anything but an heiress the
next morning when she came down to breakfast,
with her swollen face and red eyes,
which had scarcely been for a moment closed
in sleep. Everard was far brighter and
fresher. He had accepted the situation, and was resolved
to make the best of it, and though the memory
of his father’s bitter anger rested heavily on his heart,
it was softened materially by what Rosamond had told
him, and, contrary to his expectations, he had slept
soundly and quietly, and though very pale and worn,
seemed much like himself when he met Rossie in the
breakfast-room. Not a word was said on the subject
uppermost in both their minds; he carved, sitting in his
father’s old place, and she poured the coffee with a shaking
hand, and Bee did most of the talking, and was so
bright and merry that when at last she said good-by and
went to her own home, Rossie’s face was not half so
sorry-looking, or her heart so heavy and sad, though she
was just as decided with regard to the money.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>She had not yet talked with Lawyer Russell, in whom
she had the utmost confidence. He surely would know
some way out of the trouble,—some way by which she
could give Everard his own; and she sent for him to
come to the house, as she would not for the world appear
in the streets with this disgrace upon her,—for Rossie felt
it a disgrace,—of having supplanted Everard; and she
told the lawyer so when he came, and assuring him of
her unalterable determination never to touch a dollar of
the Forrest money, asked if there was not some way by
which she could rid herself of the burden and give it
back to Everard. She told him what had occurred between
herself and the judge, and asked if he did not
think it had reference to the will. The lawyer was certain
it had, and asked if Everard knew this fact. Yes,
Rossie had told him, and though he seemed glad in one
way to know his father had any regrets for the rash act,
he still adhered to his resolve to abide by the will.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But he cannot; he shall not; he must take the
money. I give it to him; it is not mine, and I will not
have it,” she said, impetuously, demanding that he
should fix it some way.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. Russell had seen Everard for a few moments
that morning, and heard from him of his firm resolve
not to enter into any arrangement whereby he could be
benefited by his father’s fortune.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Father cast me off,” he said, “and no arguments
can shake my purpose. Rossie is the heiress, and she
must take what is thrust upon her; but make it as easy
as you can for the child; let her choose her own guardian,
and I trust she will choose you. I know you will be
trustworthy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>All this the lawyer repeated to Rossie, and then, as
she still persisted in giving back, as she expressed it, he
explained to her how impossible it was for her to do it
until she reached her majority, even if Everard would
take it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are a minor yet,” he said; “are what we call
an infant. You must have a guardian, and I propose
that you take Everard, and he may also be appointed administrator
of the estate; he will then be entitled to a
certain amount of money as his legitimate fees, and so
get some of it.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>Exactly what the office of guardian and administrator
was, Rosamond did not know, but she grasped one
idea, and said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“You mean that whoever is administrator will be
paid, and if Mr. Everard is that he will get some money
which belongs to him already; that is it, is it not?
Now, I want him to have it all; if I cannot give it to
him till I am twenty-one, I shall do it then, so sure as I
live to see that day, and, meanwhile, you must contrive
some way for him to use it just the same. You can, I
know. I am quite resolved.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She had risen as she talked and stood before him,
her cheeks flushed, her eyes unnaturally bright, and her
head thrown back, so that she seemed taller than she
really was. Lawyer Russell had always liked Rossie
very much, and since that little business matter touching
the receipt, he had felt increased respect and admiration
for her, for he was certain she had helped Everard
out of some one of the many scrapes he used in those
days to be in. Looking at her now he thought what a
fine-looking girl she was growing to be, and started suddenly
as he saw a way out of the difficulty, but such a
way that he hesitated a moment before suggesting it.
Taking off his glasses, and wiping them with his handkerchief,
he coughed two or three times and then said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“How old are you, Rossie?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Fifteen last June,” was her reply, and he continued:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then you are almost fifteen and a half, and pretty
well grown. Yes, it might do; there have been queerer
things than that.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Queerer things than what?” Rossie asked, and he
replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Than what I am going to suggest. There is a way
by which Everard can use that money if he will.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is it? Tell me,” she exclaimed, her face all
aglow with excitement.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He could marry you, and then what was yours
might be his.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The lawyer had thrown the bombshell and waited for
the explosion, but there was none. Rossie’s face was
just as bright and eager, and showed not the slightest
consciousness or shrinking back from a proposition which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>would have covered some girls with blushes and confusion.
But Rossie was a simple-hearted girl, who,
never having associated much with companions of her
own age, had never had her mind filled with lovers and
matrimony, and when the lawyer proposed her marrying
Everard she looked upon it purely as a business transaction,—a
means of giving him his own; love had nothing
to do with it, nor did it for a moment occur to her that
there would be anything out of the way in such an act.
She should not live with him, of course; that would be
impossible. She should simply marry him, and then
leave him to the enjoyment of her fortune, and her first
question to the lawyer was:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you think he would have me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The old man took his glasses off again and looked at
her, wondering much what stuff she was made of.
Whatever it was he was sure she was as modest, and pure,
and innocent as a new-born child, and he answered her:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ve no doubt of it. I would if I were in his place.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And if he does, he can live right along here as if
there had been no will?” was her next question; and the
lawyer replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, just as if there had been no will;” then, remembering
he had an engagement with a client and
that it was already past the hour, he arose to go, and
Rosamond was left alone.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was not her nature to put off anything she had to
do, and feeling that she should never rest until something
definite was settled, she inquired at once where
Everard was, and finding that he was in his father’s
room, started thither immediately. He was sitting in
his father’s chair by the table, arranging and sorting
some papers and letters, but he arose when she came in
and asked what he could do for her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have been talking with Lawyer Russell,” she said,
“trying to fix it some way, and he says I cannot give it
to you till I am twenty-one; then I can do as I please,
but it is so long to wait,—five years and a-half. I am most
fifteen and a-half now. (This in parenthesis, as if to convince
him of her mature age, preparatory to what was to
follow.) I want you to have the money so much, for it is
yours, no matter what the law may say. I do not like the
law, and there is but one way out of it,—the trouble, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>mean. Lawyer Russell says if you marry me, you can use
the money just the same. Will you, Mr. Everard? I am
fifteen and a-half.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This she reiterated to strengthen her cause, looking
him straight in the face all the time, without the slightest
change of color or sign of self-consciousness.</p>

<p class='c011'>Had she proposed in serious earnestness to murder
him Everard could not have been more startled, or stared
at her more fixedly than he did, as if to see what manner
of girl this was, asking him to marry her as coolly and
in as matter-of-fact a way as she would have asked the
most ordinary favor. Was she crazy? Had the trouble
about the will actually affected her brain! He thought
so, and said to her very gently, as he would have spoken
to a child or a lunatic:</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are talking wildly, Rossie. You do not understand
what you are saying. You are tired and excited.
You must rest, and never on any account let any one
know what you have said to me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do know what I am saying, and I am neither tired
nor excited,” Rossie answered. “Lawyer Russell said
that was the only way you could use the money before I
was twenty-one.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And did he send you here to say that to me?”
Everard asked, and she replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, he only suggested it as a means, because I
would have him think of something. I came myself.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He saw she was in earnest; saw, too, that she did not
at all comprehend what she was doing, or the position in
which she was placing herself if it should be known. In
her utter simplicity and lack of worldly wisdom, she
might talk of this thing to others and put herself in a
wrong light before the world, and however painful the
task, he must enlighten her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Rossie,” he began, “you do not at all know what
you have done, or how the act might be construed, by
women, especially, if they knew it. Girls do not usually
ask men to marry them; they wait to be asked.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Slowly, as the shadow of some gigantic mountain
creeps across the valley, there was dawning on Rossie’s
mind a perception of the construction which might be
put upon her words, and the blood-red flame suffused her
face and neck, and spread to her finger-tips, as she said,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>vehemently: “You mistake me, Mr. Everard, I did not
mean it as you might marry Miss Beatrice, or somebody
you loved. I did not mean anything except a way out.
I was not going to live here at all; only marry you so
you could have the money, and then I go away and do
for myself. That’s what I meant. You know I do not
love you in a marrying way, and that I’m not the brazen-faced
thing to tell you so if I did. If I thought you
could believe that of me, I should drop dead at your
feet, and I almost wish that I could now, for very shame
of what I have done.”</p>

<p class='c011'>As she talked there had come to Rossie more and
more the great impropriety and seeming immodesty of
what, in all innocence of purpose she had done, and the
knowledge almost crushed her to the earth, making her
cover her burning face with her hands, and transforming
her at once from a child into a woman, with all a sensitive
woman’s power to feel and suffer. She did not wait
for him to speak, but went on rapidly:</p>

<p class='c011'>“You cannot despise me more than I despise myself,
for I see it now just as you do, and I must have been an
idiot, or crazy. You will loathe me always, of course,
and I cannot blame you; but remember. I did not mean
it for love, or think to stay with you. I do not love you
<em>that way</em>; such a thing would be impossible, and I would
not marry you now for a thousand times the money.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She had used her last and heaviest weapon, and without
a glance at him turned to go from the room, but he
would not suffer her to leave him thus. Over him, too,
as she talked, a curious change had come, for he saw the
transformation taking place and knew he was losing the
sweet, old-fashioned, guileless-child, who had been so
dear to him. She was leaving him, forever, and in her
place there stood a full-fledged woman, rife with a
woman’s instincts, quivering with passion, and burning
with resentment and anger, that he had not at once understood
her meaning just as she understood it. How
her words,—“I do not love you that way; such a thing
is impossible; and I would not marry you now for a
thousand times the money,” rang through his ears, and
burned themselves into his memory to be recalled afterward,
with such bitter pain as he had never known. He
did not quite like this impetuous assertion of the impossibility
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>of loving him. It grated upon him with a sense
of something lost. He must stand well with Rossie,
though her love <em>that way</em>, as she expressed it, was something
he had never dreamed of as possible.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Rossie,” be said, putting out his arm to detain her,
“you must not go from me feeling as you do now. You
have done nothing for which you need to blush, because
you had no bad intent, and the motive is what exalts or
condemns the act. Sit here by me. I wish to talk with
you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He made her sit down beside him upon the sofa, and
tried to take her hand, but she drew it swiftly away, with
a quick, imperative gesture. He would never hold her
hand again, just as he had held the little brown, sunburned
hands so many times. She was a woman now,
with all her woman’s armor bristling about her, and
as such he must treat with her. It was a novel situation
in which he found himself, trying to choose words
with which to address little Rossie Hastings, and for
a moment he hesitated how to begin. Of her strange
offer to himself he did not mean to speak, for there
had been enough said on that subject. It is true he
had neither accepted nor refused, but that was not
necessary, for she had withdrawn her proposition with
such fiery energy as would have made an allusion to
it impossible, if he had been free and not averse to
the plan. He was not free, and as for the plan, it
struck him as both laughable and ridiculous, but he
would not for the world wound the sensitive girl beside
him more than she had wounded herself, and so when at
last he began to talk with her it was simply to go again
over the whole ground, and show her how impossible it
was for him to take the money or for her to give it to
him. He appreciated her kind intentions; they were
just like her, and he held her as the dearest sister a
brother ever had; but she must keep what was her own,
and he should make his fortune as many a man had done
before him, and probably rise higher eventually than if
he had money to help him rise. He had not yet quite
decided what he should do, but that he should leave
Rothsay was probable. He should, however, stay long
enough to see that her affairs were in a way to be
smoothly managed, and to see her fairly installed in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>Forrest House with some respectable elderly lady as her
companion and protector. Lawyer Russell would, of
course, be her guardian, and the administrator of the estate.
She could not be in better hands; and however
far away he might be, he should never lose his interest
in her or cease to be her friend.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Meanwhile,” he said, with an effort to smile, “I
shall be glad if you will allow me to make your house
my home until my arrangements are completed. I am
not so proud that I will not accept that hospitality at
your hands.”</p>

<p class='c011'>I do not think that Rosamond quite comprehended
his last words. She only knew that he would not hurry
away from the Forrest House, and she looked up eagerly,
and said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am so glad, and I hope you will not hate me, or
ever believe I meant the foolish thing I said,—in that
way.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, Rossie,” he answered her, “I am far from hating
you, and how can I think you meant <em>that way</em> when
you have repeatedly declared that you would not marry
me now for a thousand times the money?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, now nor ever!” Rosamond exclaimed, energetically;
and he replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I know; men generally understand when a girl
tells them she has no love or liking for them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was something peculiar in his voice, as if what
she said hurt him a little, and Rossie detected it, and in
her eagerness to set him right involuntarily laid her
hand on his arm, and flashing upon him her brilliant,
beautiful eyes, in which the tears were shining, said to him:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Mr. Everard, you must not mistake what I mean.
I do like you, and shall for ever and ever; but not in a
marrying way, and I am so sorry I have come between
you and your inheritance. You have made me see that
I cannot now help myself, but when I am twenty-one, if I
live so long, so help me Heaven, I’ll give you back every
dollar. You will remember that, and knowing it may help
you to bear the years of poverty which must intervene.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Again the long, silken lashes were lifted, and the
dark, bright eyes looked into his with a look which sent
a strange, sweet thrill through every nerve of the young
man’s body. Rosamond had come up before him in an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>entirely new character, and he was vaguely conscious of
a different interest in her now from what he had felt before.
It was not love; it was not a desire of possession.
He did not know what it was; he only knew that his
future life suddenly looked drearier than ever to him if
it must be lived away from her and her influence. She
had risen to her feet as she was speaking, and he rose
also, and went with her to the door, and let her out, and
watched her as she disappeared down the stairs, and then
went back to his task of sorting papers, with the germ
of a new feeling stirring ever so lightly in his heart,—a
sense of something which might have made life very
sweet, and a sense as well of bitter loss.</p>

<p class='c011'>Full of shame and mortification at what she had done,
Rossie resolved to go at once to Elm Park and confess
the whole to Beatrice, whom she found at home. She
was thinking of the Forrest House and the confusion
caused by the foolish will of an angry old man, when
Rossie was announced, and, sitting down at her feet,
plunged into the very midst of her trouble by saying:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Miss Beatrice, I have come to tell you something
which makes me wish I was dead. What do you
suppose I have done?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am sure I cannot guess,” Beatrice replied, and
Rossie continued, “I asked Mr. Everard to marry me,—actually
to marry me!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wha-at!” and Beatrice was more astonished than
she had ever been in her life. “Asked Everard Forrest
to marry you! Are you crazy, or a——”</p>

<p class='c011'>She did not finish the sentence, for Rossie did it for
her, and said,</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, both crazy and a fool, I verily believe!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But how did it happen? What put such an idea
into your head?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Briefly and rapidly Rosamond repeated what had
passed between herself and Lawyer Russell, who had
asked how old she was, and on learning her age had suggested
her marrying the young man and thus giving
him back the inheritance.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And you went and did it, you little goose,” Beatrice
said, laughing until the tears ran down her cheeks; but
when she saw how distressed Rosamond was she controlled
her merriment, and listened while Rossie went on:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>“Yes, I was a simpleton not to know any better, but
I never meant him to marry me as he would marry you
or some one he loved; that had nothing to do with it at
all. And I was going right away from Forrest House to
take care of myself. I knew I could find something to
do, as nurse, or waitress, or ladies’ maid, if nothing
more; and I meant to go just as soon as the ceremony
was over and leave him all the money, and never, never
come back to be in the way.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And you told him this, and what did he say?” Beatrice
asked, her mirth all swept away before the great
unselfishness of this simple-hearted girl, who went on:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I did not tell him all that at first. I asked him to
marry me, just as I would have asked him to give me a
glass of water, and with as little thought of shame, but
the shame came afterward when I saw what I had done.
I can’t explain how it came,—the new sense of things,—I
think he looked it into me, and I felt in an instant
as if I had been blind and was suddenly restored to
sight. It was as if I had been walking unclothed in my
sleep, fearlessly, shamelessly, because asleep, and had
suddenly been roused to consciousness and saw a crowd
of people staring and jeering at me. Oh, it was so
awful! and I felt like tearing my hair and shrieking
aloud, and I said so many things to make him believe I
did not mean it for love or to live with him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And what did he say to the offer? Did he accept
or refuse?” Beatrice asked, and Rosamond replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do not think he did either. I was so ashamed
when it came to me, and talked so fast to make him
know that I would not marry him for a thousand times
the money, and did not love him, and never could.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll venture to say he was not especially delighted
with such assertions; men are not generally,” Beatrice
said, laughingly, but Rosamond did not comprehend her
meaning, or if she did, she did not pay any heed to it,
but went rapidly on with her story, growing more and
more excited as she talked, and finishing with a passionate
burst of tears, which awakened all Bee’s sympathy,
and made her try to comfort the sobbing girl, who
seemed so bowed down with shame and remorse.</p>

<p class='c011'>Her head was aching dreadfully, and there began to
steal over her such a faint, sick feeling, that she offered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>no remonstrance when Bee proposed that she spend the
night at Elm Park, and sent word to that effect to the
Forrest House.</p>

<p class='c011'>The message brought Everard at once, anxious about
Rosamond, whom he wished to see. But she declined;
her head was aching too hard to see any one, she said,
especially Everard, who must despise her always. Everard
had certainly lost the child Rossie; and the world had
never seemed so dreary to him as that night in Bee’s
boudoir, when he fairly and squarely faced the future
and decided what to do, or rather, Bee decided for him;
and with a feeling of death in his heart he concurred in
her opinion, and said he would go at once to Josephine,
and telling her of his father’s death and will, ask her to
help him build up a home where they might be happy.
He was not to show her how he shrank back and shivered
even while taking her for his wife. He was to put
the most hopeful construction on everything, and see
how much good there was in Josie.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And I am sure she will not disappoint you,” Beatrice
said, infusing some of her own bright hopefulness
into Everard’s mind, so that he did not feel quite so discouraged
when he said good-night to her, telling her that
he should start on the next morning’s train for Holburton,
but asking her not to tell Rossie of Josephine until
she heard from him.</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
It was after midnight when Everard reached
Albany, the second day after he left Rothsay.
There the train divided, the New York
passengers going one way, and the Boston
passengers another. Everard was among the
latter, and as several people left the car where he was,
he felicitated himself upon having an entire seat for the
remainder of his journey, and had settled himself for a
sleep, with his soft traveling hat drawn over his eyes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>and his valise under his head, when the door opened and
a party of young people entered, talking and laughing,
and discussing a concert which they had that evening
attended. As there was plenty of room Everard did not
move, but lay listening to their talk and jokes until
another party of two came hurrying in just as the train
was moving. The gentleman was tall, fine-looking, and
exceedingly attentive to the lady, a fair blonde, whom
he lifted in his arms upon the platform, and set down
inside the door, saying as he did so:</p>

<p class='c011'>“There, madam, I did get you here in time, though
I almost broke my neck to do it; that last ice you took
came near being our ruin.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ice, indeed! Better say that last glass you took,”
the lady retorted, with a loud, boisterous laugh, which
made Everard shiver from head to foot, for he recognized
Josephine’s voice, and knew it was his wife who
took the unoccupied seat in front of him, gasping and
panting as if wholly out of breath.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Almost dead,” she declared herself to be, whereupon
her companion, who was Dr. Matthewson, fanned
her furiously with his hat, laughing and jesting, and
attracting the attention of everybody in the car.</p>

<p class='c011'>For an instant Everard half rose to his feet, with an
impulse to make himself known, but something held him
back, and resuming his reclining attitude, with his hat
over his eyes in such a manner that he could see without
being himself seen, he prepared to watch the unsuspecting
couple in front of him, and their flirtation, for it
seemed to be that in sober earnest.</p>

<p class='c011'>Josey was all life and fun, and could scarcely keep
still a moment, but turned, and twisted, and tossed her
head, and coquetted with the doctor, who, with his arm
on the seat behind her, and half encircling her, bent over
her, and looked into her beaming face in the most lover-like
manner.</p>

<p class='c011'>Just then the door at the other end of the car opened,
and the conductor appeared with his lantern and demand
for tickets.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I shall have to pay extra,” Matthewson said.
“You ate so long that I did not have time to get my
tickets.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nonsense,” Josey answered, in a voice she evidently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>did not mean to have heard, but which nevertheless
reached Everard’s ear, opened wide to receive it, “Nonsense!
This one,” nodding towards the conductor, “never
charges <em>me</em> anything; we have lots of fun together.
I’ll pass you; put up your money and see how I’ll manage
it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And when the conductor reached their seat and
stopped before it and threw the light of his lantern in
Josey’s face, he bowed very blandly, but glanced suspiciously
at her companion, who was making a feint of
getting out his purse.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My brother,” Josey said, with a mischievous twinkle
in her blue eyes; and with an expressive “all right,”
the conductor passed on and took the ticket held up to
him by the man whose face he could not see, and at
whom Josephine now for the first time glanced.</p>

<p class='c011'>But she saw nothing familiar in the outstretched
form, and never dreamed who it was lying there so near
to her and watching all she did. So many had left at
Albany and so few taken their places that not more than
half the seats were occupied, and those in the immediate
vicinity of Josey and the doctor were quite vacant, so
the young lady felt perfectly free to act out her real
nature without restraint; and she did act it to the full,
laughing, and flirting, and jesting, and jumping just as
Everard had seen her do many a time, and thought it
charming and delightful. Now it was simply revolting
and immodest, and he glared at her from under his hat,
with no feeling of jealousy in his heart, but disgusted
and sorry beyond all power of description that she was
his wife. Rossie had stood boldly up before him and
asked him to marry her, but in her innocent face there
was no look like this on Josey’s,—this look of recklessness
and passion which showed so plainly even in the
dimness of the car. At last something which the doctor
said, and which Everard could not understand, elicited
from her the exclamation:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Aren’t you ashamed of yourself, and <em>I</em> a married
woman?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The more’s the pity,” the doctor replied, with an
expression on his face which, had Everard cared for or
even respected the woman before him, would have
prompted him to knock the rascal down. “The more’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>the pity,—for me, at least. I’ve called myself a fool a
thousand times for having cut off my nose to spite my
face.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What do you mean?” Josey asked, and he replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, nothing; only, can’t you get a divorce? I
don’t believe he cares two cents for you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know he don’t,” and Josey shrugged her shoulders
significantly; “but so long as he keeps me in money I
can stand it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And does he do that pretty well nowadays?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, so-so; he is awfully afraid of his father,
though, and I do not blame him. Such an old curmudgeon.
I saw him last summer.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You did? Where?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, at Amherst; at Commencement. I went to
the president’s reception, and made Everard introduce
me, and tried my best to captivate the old muff, but it
was of no use; he took a dreadful dislike to me, and
expressed himself freely to his son, who reported to
me——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The mean coward to do that,” the doctor exclaimed,
and Josephine replied, “No, not mean at all. I made
him tell me just what his father said. I gave him no
peace till he did, for I wanted the truth, so as to know
how far to press my claim to recognition; and I made up
my mind that my best plan was to keep quiet a while,
and let matters adjust themselves. Maybe the old man
will die; he looked apoplectic, as if he might go off in
some of his fits of temper, and then won’t I make the
money fly, for no power on earth shall keep me from the
Forrest House then.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And you’ll ride over everybody, I dare say,” the
doctor suggested, and she answered him, “You bet your
head on that,” the slang dropping from her pretty lips
as easily and naturally as if they were accustomed to it,
as indeed they were.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is Everard greatly improved?” was the next question,
and Josephine replied, “Some would think so, perhaps,
but I look upon him as a perfect milksop. I don’t
believe I could fall in love with him now. Why, he is
just as quiet and solemn as a graveyard; never laughs,
nor jokes, nor smokes, nor anything; he is fine-looking,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>though, and I expect to be very proud of him when I am
really his wife.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Which you never shall be, so help me Heaven!” was
Everard’s mental ejaculation, as he ground his teeth together.</p>

<p class='c011'>He had made up his mind, and neither Bee nor any
one else could change it. That woman, coquetting so
heartlessly with another man, and talking thus of him,
should never even be asked to share his poverty, as he
had intended doing. He would never voluntarily go into
her presence again. He would return to Rothsay, tell
his story to Bee and see what he could do to help Rossie,
and then go to work like a dog for money with which to
keep the woman quiet. And when the day came, as
come it must, that his secret was known, there should be
a separation, for live with her a single hour he would
not. This was his decision, and he only waited for the
train to stop in order to escape from her hateful presence.
But it was an express and went speeding on, while the
two in front of him kept up their conversation, which
turned at last on Rosamond, the doctor asking “if she
still lived at the Forrest House.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Josephine supposed so, though she had heard nothing
of her lately, and Dr. Matthewson asked next what disposition
she intended to make of her when she was mistress
of Forrest House.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That depends,” Josephine replied, with her favorite
shrug; “if there is nothing objectionable in her she can
stay; if she proves troublesome, she will go.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Oh, how Everard longed to shriek out that the girl
who, if she proved troublesome, was to go from Forrest
House, was the mistress there, with a right to dictate as
to who would go or stay; but that would be to betray
himself; so he kept quiet, while Josey, growing tired
and sleepy, began to nod her golden head, which drooped
lower and lower, until it rested on the shoulder of Dr.
Matthewson, whose arm encircled the sleeping girl and
adjusted the shawl about her, for it was growing cold
and damp in the car.</p>

<p class='c011'>Just then they stopped at a way station, and, taking
his valise, Everard left the train, which after a moment
went whirling on, leaving him standing on the platform
alone in the November darkness.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>There was a little hotel near by, where he passed a
few hours, until the train, bound for Albany, came along,
and carried him swiftly back in the direction of home
and Rossie, of whom he thought many times, seeing her
as she looked standing before him with that sweet pleading
expression on her face, and that musical ring in her
voice, as she asked to be his wife. How her eyes haunted
him,—those brilliant black eyes, so full of truth, and
womanly softness and delicacy. He could see them now
as they had confronted him, fearlessly, innocently, at
first, but changing in their expression as the sense of
what she had done began to dawn upon her, bringing
the blushes of shame to her tear-stained face.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dear little Rossie!” he thought; “if I were free, I
believe I’d say yes,—not for the money, but for all she
will be when she gets older.” And then there crept over
him again that undefinable sense of something lost which
he had felt when Rossie said to him, “I would not
marry you now for a thousand times the money.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He was growing greatly interested in Rossie, and
found himself very impatient during the last few hours
of his journey. What had been done in his absence, he
wondered, and was she more reconciled to the fortune
which had been thrust upon her, and how would she receive
him, and how would she look? She was not handsome,
he knew, and yet her face was very, very sweet;
her eyes were beautiful, and so was the wavy, nut-brown
hair, which she wore so becomingly in her neck,—and at
the thought of her hair there came a great lump in
Everard’s throat as he remembered the sacrifice the
unselfish girl had made for him two years before.</p>

<p class='c011'>“In all the world there is no one like little Rossie,”
he said to himself, and felt his heart beat faster with a
thrill of anticipation as the train neared Rothsay and
stopped at last at the station.</p>

<p class='c011'>Taking his valise, which was not heavy, he started
at once for the Forrest House, which he reached just as
it was growing dark, and the gas was lighted in the
dining-room.</p>

His first impulse was to ring like any stranger
at a door not his own, but thinking to himself,
“I will not wound her unnecessarily,”
he walked into the hall, and, depositing his
satchel and hat upon the rack, went to the
dining-room, the door of which was ajar, so that the first
object which met his view as he entered was Rossie,
standing under the chandelier, but so transformed from
what she was when he last saw her, that he stood for an
instant wondering what she had done; for, instead of a
child in short frock and white aprons, with loose flowing
hair, he saw a young woman in a long black dress, with
her hair twisted into a large, flat coil, and fastened with
a comb.</p>

<p class='c011'>The morning after Everard’s departure Rossie had
gone with Beatrice to order a black dress, which she insisted
should be made long. “I am through with short
clothes now,” she said to Beatrice. “I feel so old since
I did that shameful thing, that for me to dress like a
child would be as absurd as for you to do it. I am <em>not</em>
a child. I am at least a hundred years old, and you
know, it would never do for an heiress to be dressed like
a little girl. How could I discuss business with my lawyer
in short clothes and bibs,” and she laughed hysterically
as she tried to force back her tears.</p>

<p class='c011'>She had become convinced that for a few years she
must submit to be the nominal owner at least of the Forrest
property, and she had made up her mind to certain
things from which she could not be turned. One was
long dresses, and she carried her point, and gave orders
concerning some minor details with a quiet determination
which astonished Bee, who had hitherto found her
the most pliable and yielding of girls. The dress had
been sent home on the very afternoon of Everard’s
arrival, and without a thought of his coming, Rossie
shut herself in her room, and began the work of
transformation, first by twisting up her flowing hair,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>which added, she thought, at least two years to her appearance,
though she did not quite like the effect, it was
so unlike herself. But the long dress was a success, and
she liked the sound of the trailing skirt on the carpet,
and looked at herself in the glass more than she had
ever done before in her life at one time, and felt quite
satisfied with the <i><span lang="fr">tout ensemble</span></i> when she at last went
down to the dining-room, where she was standing when
Everard came in.</p>

<p class='c011'>She had been very lonely during his absence, and she
was wondering where he had gone, and when he would
return, when the door in the hall opened, and he was
there before her.</p>

<p class='c011'>For a moment she stood regarding him just as he was
studying her; then, forgetting everything in her joy
at seeing him again, she went forward to meet him, and
giving him both her hands, while a beautiful flush dyed
her cheeks, said to him:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am so glad you have come back; it was so lonesome
here, and I was just thinking about you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Her greeting was so much more cordial than Everard
had expected that it made him very happy, and he
kept her hands in his until she drew them away with a
sudden wrench, and stepping back from him, put on the
dignity she had for a moment dropped. But the action
became her and her long dress, and Everard looked
closely and admiringly at her, puzzled to know just what
it was which had changed her so much. He guessed
that she was thinking of that scene in his father’s room,
but he meant to ignore it altogether, and, if possible,
put her on her old familiar footing with himself; so,
looking at her from head to foot, he said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is it, Rossie? What have you done to yourself?
Pieced down your gown, or what, that you seem
so much taller and grander every way,—quite like Bee, in
fact? Yes, you have got on a train, sure as guns, and
your hair up in a comb; that part I don’t like; the
other change is rather becoming, but I’d rather see you
so;” and playfully pulling the comb from her head, he
let the wavy hair fall in masses upon her neck and
shoulders. “There, that’s better; it gives me little
Rossie again, and I do not wish to lose my sister.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He was trying to reassure her, and she knew it, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>was very grateful to him for the kindness, and said,
laughingly, that she put up her hair because she thought
it suited the long dresses which she meant to wear now
that she was a woman of business, but if he liked it in
her neck it should be worn so; and then she asked him
of his journey, and if he was not tired and hungry.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Tired? No; but cold as a frog and hungry as a
bear. What have we for dinner?” And he turned to
inspect the little round table laid for one. “Nothing
but toast and tea. Why, that would starve a cat. Did
you dine in the middle of the day?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Rosamond colored painfully as she answered:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I had lunch, as usual. I was not hungry. I am
never hungry now, and just have tea at night.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Rossie,” and Everard laid both hands on her
shoulders and looked her squarely in her eyes, “Rossie,
are you practicing economy, so as not to use the money
you think belongs to me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>He divined her motive, for it was the fear of using
the Forrest money needlessly which was beginning to
rule her life, and had prompted her to omit the usual
dinner, the most expensive meal of the day, and have,
instead, plain bread and butter, or toast and tea; and
Everard read the truth in her tell-tale face, and said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“That will never do, and will displease me very
much; I wish you to live as you ought, and if it is on
my account you are trying the bread and water system,
I am here now and hungry as a fish, so you can indulge
for once and order on everything there is.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was not much, but a slice of cold ham was
found, and some cheese, and jam and pickles, and Axie
made a delicious cup of coffee, and brought more bread
and butter, and offered to bake him a hoe cake if he
would wait, but he was too nearly starved to wait for
hoe cakes, he said, and he took his father’s place at the
table, and was conscious of a great degree of comfort in
and satisfaction with his surroundings, especially with
the sight of the young girl who sat opposite to him and
poured his coffee, and once or twice laughed heartily at
some of his funny remarks. He seemed in excellent
spirits, and though much of it was forced for Rossie’s
sake, he really was happier than he had been since his
father’s death. His future, so far as Josephine was concerned,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>was settled. He should never attempt to live
with her now.</p>

<p class='c011'>All the evening he sat with Rossie, and piled the
wood upon the fire until the flames leaped merrily up the
chimney, and infused a genial warmth through the
large room. And Rosamond enjoyed it thoroughly because
it was done for him. She would never have added
a single superfluous chip for herself, lest it should diminish
what was one day to go back to him; but for Everard
she would almost have burned the house itself and
felt she was doing her duty.</p>

<p class='c011'>The next morning he spent with Beatrice, to whom
he told the story of the midnight ride from Albany.</p>

<p class='c011'>“After seeing and hearing what I did, I cannot ask
her to live with me lest she should consent,” he said, and
Beatrice could not say a word in Josephine’s defense,
but asked what he proposed to do. Was he going away,
or would he remain in Rothsay? A few days ago Everard
would have answered promptly, “No, anywhere
but here, in the place so full of unpleasant memories;”
but now matters had somehow changed. That coming
home the previous night, that bright fire on the hearth,
and more than all, the sweet young face on which the
firelight shone, and the eyes which had looked so modestly
at him had made him loth to leave Rothsay and go
away from the shadowy firelight and the young girl with
the new character and the long dress. He might have
left the <em>child</em> Rossie in the hands of Beatrice and Lawyer
Russell, knowing she would be well cared for, but
to leave Miss Hastings was quite another thing, and
when Bee questioned him of his intentions, he hesitated
a moment and was glad when, in her usual impetuous,
helpful way, she said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Let me advise you before you decide. I saw Lawyer
Russell in your absence, and had a long talk with
him, and he thinks the best thing you can do is to stay
in the office where you are and accept the guardianship
of Rossie and the administration of the estate. That
will bring you money which you certainly can have no
scruples in taking, as it will be honestly earned and must
go to some one. You can still go on with your study of
law and write your essays and reviews, and so have
plenty of means to satisfy Josephine, if money will do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>it. I do not suppose you will live at the Forrest House,
that might not be best; but you will be in the village
near by and can have a general oversight of Rossie
herself as well as her affairs. What do you think of my
plan?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The idea of remaining in Rothsay and having an
oversight of Rosamond was not distasteful to the young
man, and when he left Beatrice he went directly to his
father’s office, where he found Lawyer Russell, who
made the same suggestion with regard to the guardianship
and administration of the estate which Beatrice
had done. Of course it was necessary that Rosamond
herself should be seen, and the two men went to the
Forrest House to consult with her on the subject.</p>

<p class='c011'>They found her more than willing, and in due time
Everard was regularly installed as guardian to Rosamond
and administrator of the estate. And then began a conflict
with the girl, who manifested a decision of character
and dignity of manner with which Everard found it
difficult to cope. She insisted upon knowing exactly how
much the Forrest property was estimated at, where the
money was invested, and when interest on each investment
was due. This she wrote down in a book of her
own, and then she made an estimate of the annual
expenses of the household as it was at present conducted.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t you think that a great deal?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Father did not find it too much, and he was as
close about expenditures as one need to be,” Everard
replied; and Rosamond continued:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, but I propose to reduce everything.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What do you mean, Rossie?” Everard asked,
greatly puzzled to understand this girl, who seemed so
self-possessed and assured in her long dress, to which
he charged everything new or startling in her conduct.</p>

<p class='c011'>Rosamond hesitated a moment, and then replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“You have convinced me against my will that I am
at present the lawful heir of your father’s property; I
have tried hard not to accept that as a fact, but I am
compelled to do so. You say that I am really and truly
the mistress of Forrest House, and don’t mistresses of
houses do as they like about the arrangement of matters
in the house?” Everard said, “Generally, yes,” and
Rossie went on.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>“Well, then, this is what I mean to do. First, I
shall keep a strict account of the income and a strict
account of the outgo, so far as that outgo is for me personally.
You know I have two thousand dollars of my
own, and I shall use that first, and by the time that is
gone I hope to be able to take care of myself. I am
going to have some nice, middle-aged lady in the house
as companion and teacher, and shall study hard, so
that in a year or two at most I shall be able to go out
as governess or teacher in some school. My mind is
quite made up. There are some things I cannot do,
and there are some things I can, and this is one of
them. I shall have the teacher and get an education,
and meanwhile shall live as economically as possible;
and I wish you to sell the horses and carriage,
too; I shall never use them, and horses cost so much to
keep. I like to walk, and have good strong feet and
ankles,—great big ones, you used to say,” and she tried to
smile, but there was a tear on her long eyelashes as she
referred to a past which had been so pleasant and free
from care. “A part of the land is a park,” she went on,
“and does not need much attention except to pick up
and prune, and cut the grass occasionally. Uncle Abel
told me so. I have talked with him ever so much, and
he says if I give him three dollars more a month he can
do all there is to be done in the grounds, if he does not
have the horses to look after, so I shall keep him, and
his little grandson, Jim, to do errands and wait on the
table and door, and Aunt Axie to work in the house, and
send the rest away.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, Rosamond,” Everard said, staring at her in
amazement, “you don’t know what you are talking
about; Aunt Axie cannot do all the work.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nor will she,” Rossie said; “I am going to shut up
most of the house, and only use two rooms up stairs, one
for myself and one for the teacher, and the dining-room
down stairs, and little sitting-room off for any calls I
may have. I can take care of my own room and the
teacher’s, too, if she likes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She had settled everything, and it only remained for
Everard, as her guardian, to acquiesce in her wishes when
he found that nothing which he could say had power to
change her mind. She had developed great decision of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>character, and so clear a head for business in all its details,
that Everard told her, laughingly, that it would be
impossible for him to cheat her in so much as a penny
without being detected. He was intensely interested in
this queer girl, as he styled her to himself, and so far as
was consistent with her good, did everything she asked,
proving himself the most indulgent of guardians and
faithful of administrators. Together with Beatrice he
inquired for and found, in Cincinnati, a Mrs. Markham,
a lady, and the widow of an English curate, who seemed
exactly fitted for the situation at Forrest House as Rossie’s
teacher and companion. All Rossie’s wishes with
regard to reducing the expenditures of the household
were carried out, with one exception. Everard insisted
that she should keep one of the horses, which she could
drive, and the light covered carriage which had been
Mrs. Forrest’s. To this Rossie consented, but sent away
three of the negroes, and shut up all the rooms not absolutely
essential to her own and Mrs. Markham’s comfort.
In this way she would save both fuel and lights, and the
wear of furniture, she said, and to <em>save</em> for Everard had
become a sort of mania with her. And when he saw he
could not move her, Everard humored her whims and
suffered her in most things to have her way. He
had a cheap, quiet boarding-house in town, where he was
made very comfortable by his landlady, who felt a little
proud of having Judge Forrest’s son in her family, even
if he were disowned and poor. Blood was better than
money, and lasted longer, she said, and as Everard had
the bluest of blood, she made much of him, and petted
him as he had never been petted in his life. And so,
under very favorable auspices, began the new life of the
two persons with whom this story has most to do.</p>

<p class='c011'>So far as Rossie was concerned it bade fair to be very
successful. Mrs. Markham was both mother and friend
to the young girl, in whom she was greatly interested.
A thorough scholar herself, she had a marvelous power
of imparting her information to others, and Rossie gave
herself to study now with an eagerness and avidity which
astonished her teacher, and made her sometimes try to
hold her back, lest her health should fail from too close
application. But Rossie seemed to grow stronger, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>fresher, and rounder every day, notwithstanding that all
her old habits of life were changed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Every day Beatrice came to the Forrest House,
evincing almost as much interest in Rosamond’s education
as Mrs. Markham herself, and giving her a great
deal of instruction with regard to her French accent and
music. Every Sunday Everard dined with her, and
called upon her week days when business required that
he should do so; and he looked forward to these visits
with the eagerness of a schoolboy going home. In some
respects Everard was very happy, or, at least, content,
during the first months of the new life. He was honorably
earning a very fair livelihood, and at the same time
advancing with his profession. No young man in town
was more popular than himself, for the people attached
no blame to him for his father’s singular will, which
they thought unjustifiable. There was, of course, always
present with him a dread of the day which must come
when his secret would be known,—but Holburton was an
out-of-the-way place, where his friends never visited, and
it might be months or even years before Josephine heard
of his father’s death, and until that time he meant to be
as happy as he could. Josephine did not trouble him
often with letters which he felt obliged to answer. He
took care to supply her frequently with money, which he
sent in the form of drafts, without any other message, and
she seemed satisfied. He had sold his horse, his stock
was yielding him something regularly now, and with the
percentage due him for his services as administrator, he
was doing very well, and would have been quite content
but for that undefinable sense of loss ever present, with
him. He had lost the child Rossie, and he wanted her
back again, with the short gingham dress and white apron,
and cape bonnet, and big boots, and little tanned hands;
wanted the girl whom he had teased, and petted, and
domineered over at will; who used to romp the livelong
day with the dogs and cats, and teach even the colts and
calves to run and race with her; who used to chew gum,
and burst the buttons off her dress, and eat green apples
and plums, and cry with the stomach-ache. All these
incidents of the past as connected with Rossie came back
to him so vividly, that he often said to himself:</p>

<p class='c011'>“What has become of the child Rossie?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>She had been such a rest, such a comfort to him, and
in one sense she was a comfort now, at least she was a
study, an excitement and a puzzle to him, and he always
found himself looking forward to the visits which he
made her with an immense amount of interest. Every
Sunday he dined with her, and walked with her to
church in the evening, and sat in his father’s pew, and
walked back with her and Mrs. Markham to the house
after service was over, and said good-night at the door,
and wondered vaguely if women like Mrs. Markham
always went to church, if they never had a headache, or
a cold, and were compelled to stay at home. Occasionally,
too, he went to the Forrest House on business, asking
only for Rosamond; but Mrs. Markham always
appeared first, coming in as if by accident, and seating
herself, with the shawl she was knitting, far off by the
window, just where she could see what was done at the
other end of the room. After a little Rosamond would
appear, in her long black gown, which trailed over the
carpet as she walked, and exasperated Everard with the
sound of its trailing, for to that he charged the metamorphosis
in Rossie. It was the cause of everything, and
had changed her into the quiet, dignified Miss Hastings,
to whom it was impossible to speak as he used to speak
to Rossie.</p>

<p class='c011'>One day as he was looking from his office window he
saw Mrs. Markham going by for the long walk she was
accustomed to take daily. He had seen her pass that
way frequently with Rosamond at her side, but Rossie
was not with her now; and though Everard had been at
the Forrest House the night before, he suddenly remembered
a little matter of business which made it very
necessary for him to go again, and was soon walking
rapidly up the long avenue to his old home. Aunt Axie
let him in, and went for Rossie, who came to him at
once,—evincing some surprise at seeing him again so
soon, and asking, rather abruptly, if there was more
business.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” and he blushed guiltily, and felt half vexed
with her for standing up so straight and dignified, with
her hands holding to the back of a chair, while he explained
that the Ludlow mortgage would be due in a few
days, and asked if she would like to have it renewed, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>it could be, or have the money paid and invested somewhere
else at a higher rate? He had forgotten to mention
it the previous night, he said, and as she had
expressed a wish to know just how the moneys were
invested, he thought best to come again and consult her.</p>

<p class='c011'>Rossie did not care in the least; she would leave it
entirely to him, she said, and then waited, apparently for
him to go. But Everard was in no haste, and passing
her a chair he said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sit down, Rossie. I am not going just yet. Now
that I have you to myself for a few moments, I wish to
ask how long this state of things is to go on?”</p>

<p class='c011'>She did not know at all what he meant, and looked
at him wonderingly as she took the proffered chair and
said, “What state of things? What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I mean the high and mighty air you have put on
toward me. Why, you are so cold and dignified that
one can’t touch you with a ten-foot pole, and this ought
not to be. I have a right to expect something different
from you, Rossie. I dare say I can guess in part what
is the matter. You are always thinking of that day you
came to me in father’s room and said what you did. But
for Heaven’s sake, forget it. I have never thought of it
as a thing of which you need feel ashamed. You had
tried every way to give me the money, and when that
idea was suggested you seized upon it without a thought
of harm, and generously offered to marry me and then
run away, and so reinstate me in my rights.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Rossie’s face was scarlet, but she did not speak, and
he continued:</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was a noble, unselfish act, and just like you, and
I don’t think a whit the less of you for it. I know you
did not mean it <em>that way</em>, as you assured me so vehemently.
I am your brother. You have known me as
such ever since you can remember anything here, and my
little sister was very dear to me, and I miss her so much
now that I have lost her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Lost her, Mr. Everard! Lost me! No, you haven’t,”
Rosamond said, her eyes filling with tears, which shone
like stars, as Everard went on:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I have. I lost her when you put on those long
dresses and began to meet me in such a formal way, with
that prim, old duenna always present, as if she was afraid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>I was going to eat you up. Mrs. Markham is very nice,
no doubt, but I don’t like that in her. It may be English
propriety, but it is not American. I’m not going
to hurt you, and I want sometimes to see you here alone
and talk freely and cozily, as we used to talk,—about
your cats, if you like, I don’t care what, if it brings you
back to me, for you don’t know how I long for the child
whom I used to tease so much.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He stopped talking, and Rossie was almost beautiful,
with the bright color in her cheeks and the soft
light in her eyes, which were full of tears, as she said,
impulsively, “You shall have the child Rossie again,
Mr. Everard. I am glad you have told me what you
have. It will make it so much easier now to see you.
I was always thinking of <em>that</em>, and feeling that you were
thinking of it, too, and I am happy to know you are not.
I don’t wish to be stiff and distant with you, and you
may come as often as you choose, and Mrs. Markham
need not always be present,—that was as much my idea
as hers; but the long dress I must wear now; it suits me
better than the short clothes which showed my feet so
much. You know how you used to tease me.” She was beginning
to seem like herself again, and Everard enjoyed
himself so well that he staid until Mrs. Markham returned,
and when at last he left, it was with a feeling
that he liked the graceful, dignified young girl almost
as well as he had once liked the child Rossie.</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
A few days after Everard’s interview with
Rossie, Beatrice went to New York, where
she spent the winter, returning home early in
April, and bringing with her a dark-eyed,
dark-haired, elfish-looking little girl, whom
she called <em>Trixey</em>, and whose real name was Beatrice Belknap
Morton. She was the daughter of a missionary to the
Feejee Islands, who had brought his invalid wife home
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>to America, hoping the air of the Vermont hills might
restore life and health to her worn-out, wasted frame.
Bee did not know of his return, and saw him first at a
missionary meeting which she attended with the friend
at whose house she was stopping.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The Rev. Theodore Morton will now tell us something
of his labors among the Feejees,” the presiding
clergyman said, and Bee, who was sitting far back near
the door, rose involuntarily to her feet in order to see
more distinctly the man who was just rising to address
the audience, and who stood before them, tall, erect, and
perfectly self-possessed, as if addressing a crowded New
York house had been the business of his life.</p>

<p class='c011'>Was it her Theo, whom she had sent from her to the
woman in Vermont, more willing than herself to share
his toils and privations in a heathen land. <em>That</em> Theo
had been spare and thin, with light beard and sandy
hair; this man was broad-shouldered, with well-developed
physique, and the hair, which lay in curls around his
massive brow, was a rich chestnut brown, as was the
heavy beard upon his cheek. It could not be Theo, she
though, as she sank back into her seat; but the moment
she heard the deep, musical tones of the voice which
had once a power to thrill her, she knew that it was he,
and listened breathlessly while he told of his work in
those islands of the sea, and by his burning eloquence
and powers of speech stirred up his hearers to greater
interest in the cause. He loved his work because it was
his Master’s, and loved the poor, benighted heathen, and
he only came home because of the sick wife and little
ones, who needed change of scene and air.</p>

<p class='c011'>Where was his wife, Bee wondered, and when the
meeting was over she drove to the house of a clergyman
who she knew kept a kind of missionary hotel, and from
him learned the address of the Rev. Theodore Morton.
It was not at an uptown hotel, but at a second-rate
boarding-house on Eighth street, where rooms and board
were cheap, and there, on the third floor back, she found
Mrs. Theodore Morton, the school-mistress from Vermont,
who had so offended her taste with spectacles and
a brown alpaca dress. The landlady had bidden her go
directly to the room, where she knocked at the door, and
then stood listening to a sweet, childish voice singing a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>lullaby to a baby. Again she knocked, and this time the
voice said “Come in,” and she went in, and found a little
girl of five years old, with black hair and eyes, and a
dark, saucy, piquant face, seated in a low rocking-chair,
and holding in her short, fat arms a pale, sickly baby of
four months or thereabouts, which she was trying to
hush to sleep. Near her, in an arm-chair, sat a round,
rosy-cheeked little girl, who might have been three years
old, though her height indicated a child much younger
than that. On the bed, with her face to the wall, and
apparently asleep, lay a woman, emaciated and thin,
with streaks of gray in the long, black hair floating in
masses over the pillow. Bee thought she must have
made a mistake, but something in the blue eyes of the
chubby girl in the chair arrested her attention, and she
said to the elf with the baby in her arms:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is Mrs. Morton here,—Mrs. Theodore Morton?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, that’s ma,—on the bed. She’s sick; she’s always
sick. Tum in, but don’t make a noise, ’cause I’se
tryin’ to rock baby brother to seep, like a good ’ittle
dirl.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“An’ I’s dood, too,” chirped the dumpling in the high
chair. “I’ve climbed up here to det out of the way, an’
not wake mamma an’ make her head ache, an’ papa’s
goin’ to bring me some tandy, he is, when he tums from
the meetin’.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was no mistaking that blue-eyed, fair-haired
child for other than Theodore Morton’s, and Beatrice
stooped down and kissed her round, rosy cheek, and
asked:</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is your name, little one?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mamie,—Mamie Morton; but dey calls me Bunchie,
’cause I’s so fat, an’ I’s mamma’s darlin’, and was tree
’ears old next week,” was the reply; and then Bee
turned to the elf, and laying her hand on the jet-black
hair, said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“And your name is what?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Trixey everybody calls me but papa, who sometimes
says Bee; but that ain’t my very name. It’s ever so
long, with many B’s in it,” was the reply, and Bee’s
heart gave a great bound, as she said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is it Beatrice?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, an’ more too, Beatrice sometin’.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>“Beatrice Belknap, perhaps,” guessed the lady, and
the child replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s it, but how did you know?” and the great
eyes, so very black and inquisitive, looked wonderingly
at Bee, who answered:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am Beatrice Belknap, the lady for whom you were
named, and I’ve come to see you. I used to know your
father. Is he well?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Papa? Yes, he’s very well, but mamma,” and the
child put on a very wise and confidential look as she
added in a whisper, “mamma’s <em>shiffless</em> all the time.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bee could not repress a smile at this quaint form of
speech, and she asked:</p>

<p class='c011'>“And do you take care of baby? Is there no nurse?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We had Leah over home,” Trixey said, “but she
couldn’t come with us, ’cause we’re so poor, an’ papa has
no money.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But he buyed me some yed soos,” Bunchie said,
sticking up her little feet, encased in a new pair of red
morocco shoes, the first she had ever had or probably
seen.</p>

<p class='c011'>How Beatrice’s heart yearned over these little ones
who had known only poverty, and how she longed to
lavish upon them a part of her superfluous wealth.
There was a stir on the bed; the sleeper was waking,
and a faint voice called:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Trixey, are you here?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, mamma. I’ve rocked brother to seep,” Trixey
said, starting up, but holding fast to the baby as a cat
holds to its kitten. “There’s a lady here, mamma, comed
to see us,” the child continued, and then Mrs. Morton
roused quickly, and turning on her side fixed her great
sunken eyes inquiringly on Beatrice, who stepped forward,
and with that winning sweetness and grace so
natural to her, said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I doubt if you remember me, Mrs. Morton, as you
only saw me once, and that for a few moments, before
the <em>Guide</em> sailed from here six years ago. I am an old
friend of your husband’s. I met him in Paris first and
many times after in America. Perhaps you have heard
him speak of Miss Beatrice Belknap?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, Trixey was named for you. It was kind in
you to call,” Mrs. Morton said, and now she sat upon the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>side of the bed and began to bind up her long black hair,
which had fallen in her neck.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Let me do that,” Bee said, as she saw how the exertion
of raising her arms made the invalid cough; and
drawing off her gloves, her white hands, on which so
many costly jewels were shining, were soon arranging
and twisting the long hair which, though mixed with
gray, was very glossy and luxuriant. “You have nice
hair, and so much of it,” she said, and Mrs. Morton
replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, it is very heavy even yet, and is all I have
left of my youth, though I am not so very old, only
thirty; but the life of a missionary’s wife is not conducive
to the retaining of one’s good looks.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Was it so very dreadful?” Bee asked, a little curious
about the life which might have been her own.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not dreadful, but hard; that is, it was very hard
on me, who was never strong, though I seemed so to
strangers. I could not endure much, and was sick all
the way out, so sick that I used to wish I might die and
be buried in the sea. Then Trixey came so soon, and the
care of her, and the food, and the climate, and the manner
of living there, and the terrible homesickness! Oh,
I was so homesick, at first, that I should surely have
died, if Theo had not been so good. He was always
kind, and tried to spare me every way.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I am sure he did,” Bee said; feeling at the
same time a kind of pity for Theo, who, for six years,
had spared and been kind to this woman, after having
known and loved her, Beatrice Belknap.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a great difference between these two
women; one, bright, gay, sparkling, full of life and
health, with wealth showing itself in every part of her
elegant dress, from the India shawl which she had
thrown across the chair, to the sable muff which had
fallen on the floor; the other, sick, tired, disheartened,
old before her time; and, alas, habited in the same
brown alpaca in which she had sailed away, and which
had been so obnoxious to Beatrice. The material had
been the best of the kind, and after various turnings and
fixings, had been made at last into a kind of wrapper,
which was trimmed with a part of another old brown
dress of a different shade. Nothing could be more unbecoming
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>to that thin, sallow face, and those dark, hollow
eyes, than that dress, and never was contrast greater between
two women than that revealed by the mirror
which hung just opposite the bed where Mrs. Morton
was sitting, with Beatrice standing by her. Both looked
in it together, and met each other’s eyes, and must have
thought of the same thing, for Mrs. Morton at once
changed her seat where she could not see herself, and as
the hair was put up Beatrice also sat down, and, without
seeming to do so, inspected very minutely the woman
who was Theodore Morton’s wife.</p>

<p class='c011'>She was well educated,—and she was well born, too,
being the daughter, and granddaughter, and great-granddaughter
of clergymen, while on her mother’s side she
came from merchants and lawyers, and very far back
boasted a lieutenant-governor. But she lacked that
softness, and delicacy, and refinement of manner which
was Bee’s great charm. She had angles and points, and
was painfully frank and outspoken, and never practiced
a deception in her life, or kept back anything she thought
she ought to say, or flinched from any duty. In short,
she was New England to the back-bone, and showed it
in everything. Vermont, or rather the little town of
Bronson, where she was born, was placarded all over her,
just as Paris and New York were written all over Bee,
and she rejoiced in it and was proud of her birthplace.
Beatrice’s presence there was evidently a trouble and an
embarrassment. When Theodore Morton went to her
and asked her to be his wife he had told her frankly
that he had loved another and been refused, and she had
accepted him, and asked no question about her rival. On
board the ship in the harbor she had been so occupied
with her own personal friends who were there to say
good-by, that, though introduced to Miss Belknap, she
had paid no attention to her, or noticed her in any way.
When her first child was born, ten months after her
marriage, she had wished to name it Sarah, for her
mother, but her husband said to her: “I would like to
call it Beatrice Belknap, if you do not mind.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She did mind, for she knew now that Beatrice Belknap
was her husband’s first choice, but she held it every
wife’s duty to obey her husband so far as it was right,
and as there was nothing wrong in this proposition she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>consented without a word, and the baby was named for
Beatrice, but familiarly called Trixey, as that pet name
suited her better. Of the Beatrice over the sea Theodore
never spoke, and his wife never questioned him, and
so she knew nothing of her until she woke from sleep
and found her there in all her fresh beauty and bright
plumage, which seemed so out of place in that humble
room. Of course she was embarrassed and confused,
but she would not apologize, except as she spoke of the
life of privation they had led in that heathen land.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And yet there was much to make me happy,” she
said. “I knew we were doing God’s work,—which
somebody must do,—and when some poor creatures blessed
us for coming to tell them the story of Jesus, I was so
glad that I had gone to them, and my trials seemed as
nothing. And then, there was Theo, always the same
good, true husband to me.” She said this a little defiantly,
as if to assure Beatrice that the heart, which
once might have beaten for her, was now wholly loyal
to another.</p>

<p class='c011'>And Bee accepted it sweetly, but had her own opinion
on the subject still.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, the Mr. Morton I used to know could never be
anything but kind to one he loved well enough to make
his wife,” she said; and then, by way of turning the conversation
from Theodore to something else, she asked:
“Were you sick all the time you were there?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, most of the time. My children were born so
fast,—four in five years. I lost a noble boy between
Mamie and baby Eddie; that almost killed me, and I’ve
never been the same since. There is consumption in our
family far back, and I fear I have inherited it. My
cough is terrible at times, but I hope much from Vermont
air and Vermont nursing. Oh, I have longed so for the
old home at the foot of the mountain, for some water
from the well, for mother, and to lie on her bed as I
used to when I was a child, and had the sick-headache.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Her eyes filled with tears as she said this, and she
leaned wearily back in her chair, while Bee involuntarily
laid her soft, warm hand upon the thin, wasted one where
the wedding-ring sat so loosely. Just then the door
opened and Theodore Morton came in, the same Beatrice
had heard at the missionary meeting, the same with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>whom she had strolled through the Kentucky woods and
on the shore of Quinsigamond Pond. He knew her at
once, but nothing in his face or voice betrayed any consciousness
of the past, if he felt it. He met her naturally
and cordially, said he was very glad to see her, that it was
kind in her to find them out, and then passed on to his
sick wife, on whose head he laid his hand caressingly,
asking if it ached as hard as ever, or if she was feeling a
little better.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You look better certainly,” he said, regarding her
curiously, not knowing that the improvement was owing
to the artistic way in which Beatrice had knotted up the
heavy hair, which showed at the sides and added apparent
breadth to the thin, narrow face.</p>

<p class='c011'>What a noble-looking man he was, and how well he
appeared, as if he had associated with kings and queens
instead of the poor heathen, and what a change his
presence made in that dingy back room, which, with
him in it, had at once an atmosphere of home and domestic
happiness. He had been there but a few moments
at the most, but in that time he had smoothed his wife’s
hair, and called her Mollie, the pet name she liked, and
made her smile, had tossed Bunchie in the air and stuffed
her fat hands with candy, had kissed little Trixey, and
given her a new picture-book, and taken the baby from
her and was walking with it up and down the room to
hush its wailing cry. And between times he talked to
Beatrice, naturally and easily, asking for the people he
used to know in Rothsay, and if she was living there
now; then, stopping suddenly, he said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I beg your pardon for taking it for granted you
were Miss Belknap still. Are you married? You used
to be a sad flirt.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He said the last playfully, and the two looked at each
other an instant, and their eyes dropped suddenly as if
alarmed at what they saw.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am Bee Belknap still, and as great a flirt as
ever,” Bee replied; and then the Rev. Theo did a most
remarkable thing; he turned to his wife, and said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mollie, dear, do you know I was once foolish
enough to ask this gay bird to go with me to the Feegees,
and she had the good sense to refuse. Wouldn’t she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>have cut a fine figure out there with all her finery and
fashion?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I know,” Mollie said faintly, while Bee rejoined,
laughingly: “You ought to be very thankful that I
preferred fashion to Feegees; such a life as I should
have led you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You would have died,” Mollie rejoined, and the
conversation on that subject ceased.</p>

<p class='c011'>Theo had set things right for them all by his plain
and playful allusion to the past, which, from that allusion,
would be supposed to have no part in his present
life, and to have left no mark upon him. He seemed
very happy with his children, and very kind to his wife,
who was a different creature with his strong, mesmeric
influence near her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I believe she’d be passably good-looking if she
were decently dressed. She has good hair, not bad features,
and rather fine eyes; but where are the glasses,
she surely wore them away?” Beatrice thought, and at
last she ventured to say: “Excuse me, Mrs. Morton, but
did you not wear glasses on shipboard six years ago?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” was the reply, “my eyes were weak from
over-study, trying to master the language, and I was
obliged to wear glasses for a time. I laid them off after
Trixey was born. Theo never liked me in them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>As the short March afternoon was wearing to a close
Beatrice soon rose to go, after first asking how long the
Mortons intended to remain in the city.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We have written to mother to know if she can receive
us,” Mrs. Morton said, “and shall go as soon as we
get her answer. I am afraid we shall crowd and worry
her too much, for the house is small, and she and father
are old and poor, and may not want us all.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Never mind, Mollie,” Theo said, “don’t kill the bear
till you see it;” then, turning to Beatrice, he added, not
complaining, but laughingly, “Mollie has a great way of
borrowing trouble, while I wait till it comes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s my poor health; my nerves; I can’t help it,”
the invalid said, with a quiver in her voice and about her
lips.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of course you can’t, Mollie,” and again the broad,
warm hand was placed upon Mollie’s head by way of reassurance.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>Theo went with Bee to her carriage, and handed her
in, and told her to come again, and said he would call on
her, and was not one whit more demonstrative when alone
with her than he was up in that back room with his
nervous wife looking on. But Bee did not quite believe
he was perfectly happy. How could he be with
<em>Mollie</em>.</p>

<p class='c011'>And yet she was very sorry for Mollie, who, she was
sure, was a much better woman than herself, and the
next day, which was very fine, she drove again to No.——
Eighth street, and invited the sick woman to ride.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The coupé is close, and I brought an extra shawl to
keep you nice and warm,” she said, as she threw over
Mrs. Morton’s shoulders her second-best India shawl,
which covered up the black delaine, trimmed with half-worn
silk, which Mollie wore.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was her best, Bee knew, for little Trix had said,
exultingly, “Ma’s got on her bestest down to day.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, my best, and almost my all,” Mrs. Morton
said, “but I have money for a new one; some English
ladies give it me, and told me to get a black silk. I’ve
never had one in my life: would you mind going with
me somewhere and helping me pick it out: you are a so
much better judge of silk than I am?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bee flinched a little inwardly as she looked at the
dowdy woman, in her queer, old-fashioned bonnet, and
thought of the fashionable ladies, her friends, who were
sure to be shopping at this hour, and who always spied
her out and pounced upon her. But she shut her teeth
together hard, bade the coachman drive to Arnold’s,
resolved to beard the elegant man at the silk counter,
who was always so obsequious to Miss Belknap, the
heiress and belle. Everybody was out that day, and
Bee met at least half a dozen friends before she reached
the silk counter, where she found her man, bland, attentive,
and eager to serve her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Black silk,” she said, and he showed her at once
samples varying in price from eight to ten dollars a
yard.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear, no! something cheaper, much cheaper,”
Mrs. Morton gasped; and then the clerk knew that the
faded, countrified-looking woman whom he had not at
all considered as belonging to Miss Belknap, was the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>real customer, and his face changed its expression at
once as he put back his high-priced silks with an injured
air, and said: “You will find what you want farther
down. We have nothing cheap here.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think you have,” Beatrice said to him. “Show
me something at four dollars a yard.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Certainly,” and again the clerk was all smiles and
attention, and began to exhibit his goods, while Mrs.
Morton whispered nervously, “But, Miss Belknap, you
don’t understand. I’ve only forty dollars; I cannot
afford it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I can,” Beatrice replied. “I have more money than
I can spend. Let me give you the dress. I’ll take it as a
great favor, and you can use the forty dollars for something
else.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There were tears in Mrs. Morton’s eyes, and her face
was very white, as she said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, no; that’s too much from you, a stranger.
Theo would not like it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll make it right with Theo. I’m not a stranger to
him,” Bee answered, and so the silk was bought, and velvet
to trim it with, and then they moved to another part
of the store for something for the children, and met a
whole regiment of ladies, Mrs. Gen. Stuckup with Mrs.
Sniffe, who were delighted to see Bee, but looked
askance at her companion, wondering if it was some poor
relation of whom they had never heard, and commiserating
Bee, who must feel so mortified.</p>

<p class='c011'>She was not mortified one whit now, though she had
been at the start, but she despised herself thoroughly
for it and was very attentive to her companion, and when
Mrs. Sniffe, who was frightfully envious of her, and never
failed to sting her if she could do it, asked her in an
aside, with a roll of her eyes; “Who is that frump of a
woman, and how came she fastened to you?” she answered,
readily, “It is Mrs. Theodore Morton, wife of
a returned missionary, whose name you must have seen
if you ever read the papers. He is very highly esteemed
by the board as a Christian and a gentleman. Some connection
of Gov. Morton, of Massachusetts, I believe.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, yes, and you are doing missionary work in your
own way, I see. It’s quite like you,” Mrs. Sniffe said, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>she passed on to the laces and left Bee and Mrs. Morton
to themselves.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That woman made fun of me and called me a
frump,” Mrs. Morton falteringly said, with a quivering
lip, but fire in her eye, as she looked after the retreating
bundle of velvet, and silk, and ostrich feathers.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Never mind. You don’t care for her. They say
she used to work in the factory at Lowell, and married a
man old enough to be her father, but he had a million,
and died, and left it to her, and now she is Mrs. Sniffe,
and leads a certain class of simpletons,” Bee replied, and
so Mrs. Morton was reconciled to Mrs. Sniffe’s snub, and
more than reconciled to her husband’s first love when
she saw how kind and generous she was, spending her
money so freely, and doing it all as if it were a great
favor to herself rather than an act of charity to the poor
woman, who returned to her boarding-house laden with
more dry-goods for herself and children than she had
seen during the entire period of her married life.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was two days before Beatrice went again to her
family on Eighth street, and then she found Mrs. Morton
alone, and very much depressed, on account of a letter
that morning received from her father.</p>

<p class='c011'>As she gave Beatrice the letter to read, I will give it
to my readers. It was as follows:</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>My Beloved Daughter</span>:—Many thanks be to God
for having brought you safely to America, and given us
to believe that we shall see your face again and that of
the little ones, our grandchildren. I cannot tell you how
glad we are, your mother, and myself, and Aunt Nancy,
too, though I think she dreads the litter and the grease-spots
the children are sure to make, her life has been so
quiet, you know. For myself, I long to see the bairns
and hear their young voices. It will make me young
again, though the years are bearing me down now so
fast. Sixty-eight is nigh on to three score and ten, our
allotted time.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And now about your coming here for the summer.
Of course you are welcome as the blossoms of May, but
I should be keeping back something if I did not tell you
just the situation of things in the old parsonage. Your
mother is down with nervous prostration, and has been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>for months, and as she is very weak I occupy a separate
room from hers. Your Aunt Nancy has another, and
that only leaves your own old room for you and Theodore
and the three children. Of course, I don’t count
that place over the woodshed, where we can have a bed
for a girl or a boy. You cannot have three children in
your room even when your husband is away, it is so
small, and Nancy would as soon have a woodchuck in
with her as a child; so at first it was a question how to
dispose of you. But Providence provided, as He always
does. Your mother and I made it a subject of prayer,
asking in our blind way that God would incline Nancy
either to change rooms, or to have a little cot set up in
hers, and feeling confident He would hear the prayer of
faith. He did hear and answer, but in His own way,
which was not ours. He did not soften your Aunt
Nancy, but he sent your cousin Julia to us to say that
she would gladly take <em>one</em> of the little girls for a while.
You know she is rich and has no children, and it will be
a nice home for the child, and Nancy says, ‘Let her have
the one that will be likely to fill our house the fullest
and make the most <em>to do</em>,’ whatever that may be.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And now, having stated the case as it is, we shall
be glad to see you any day, only on Nancy’s account you
may as well let us know, as everything will have to be
scoured with soap and sand. I hear her now at the
kitchen table, which somebody has spilt a drop of milk
on.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Your mother joins me in love, and prays for you.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Affectionately your father,</div>
      <div class='line in36'>“<span class='sc'>Cyrus Brown</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“What a nice letter, and what a good old man he
must be,” Beatrice said, as she finished reading.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” Mrs. Morton answered, hesitatingly; “it is
nice, and he is good, and mother, too; but the idea of
losing one of the children is dreadful to me. There is
always some thorn in my rose. I have thought so much
of going back to the old house under the apple trees, and
having my little ones with me; and now you see what
he says,—one must go to Cousin Julia Hayden.”</p>

<p class='c011'>In Mrs. Morton’s roses there would always be thorns,
fancied or real, but Bee did not tell her so; she merely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>asked: “Who is Mrs. Hayden? Is she fond of children?
Will she be kind to them?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She is my cousin on mother’s side,” Mrs. Morton
said. “She is the great woman of Bronson, and the
richest, and lives in the grandest house. She never had
any children of her own, and I do not think her very
fond of them. She would be kind in a certain way, but
very exacting. She does not understand them. She
used to teach school, and was very strict, indeed. She
could not make allowances for the difference between
herself and little folks. She is Aunt Nancy’s own
niece.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And who is Aunt Nancy?” Bee asked, and Mrs.
Morton replied, “Mother’s old maid sister, Nancy
Phillips, who has always lived with us. She is the neatest,
most particular person you ever saw; and because
she is strong and willing, and mother is feeble, she has
run the house so long that she thinks it is her own, and
orders father as if he were a dog. But she has many
excellent traits, and they could not live without her. She
was always kind to me, and I’d rather trust my children
with her than with Cousin Julia Hayden. It is very
hard, and makes me so nervous.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I can fancy it all,” Bee said; and then, recurring
to the letter, she added: “You are to give up the
one which will fill the house the fullest and make the
most noise. Now, which is that?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Instantly the eyes of both went over to the window,
where Trixey was combing and brushing Bunchie’s hair,
pulling and snarling it awfully, and talking all the time
as fast as her tongue could fly. Yes, there was no mistake.
Little Trix would fill the house the fullest and
make the greatest <em>to do</em>, and Mrs. Hayden would never
understand her, or make allowance for her busy, active
ways; and Beatrice wanted her for herself, and said at
last to Mrs. Morton: “Will you let me have Trixey, for
as long a time as Mrs. Hayden would keep her? I know
I can make her happy. You can trust her with me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Morton was sure of that. During the few days
she had known Miss Belknap she had received from her
too many kindnesses to think of her as other than a
friend, and one to be trusted. At first, she had looked a
little suspiciously upon the elegant woman who had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>Theo’s first choice, and who was so unlike herself, and
she had more than once thought, “How could he have
chosen me after knowing her?” She did not say “love
me,” for she had been morally sure that when she became
Theodore Morton’s wife there was not much love
on his side at least. She had loved him for years, and
been picked out for his wife since she was a little
girl. His father and grandfather had been clergymen,
and he had been her father’s pupil when the Rev. Mr.
Brown taught a small school for boys, by way of ekeing
out his salary. Theo had said then he meant to be a missionary,
and she had said she meant to be one, too, and wise
ones predicted that they might go together. But the
young man wandered very far away from quiet Bronson,
and its staid, old-fashioned people, and went to Europe,
and fell in with Bee Belknap, and forgot the plain, angular
Mary Brown, in the home under the apple trees, who
had mended his clothes, and studied Latin and Greek,
and talked enthusiastically of a missionary’s life as the
happiest and best a man could choose. He had never
quite believed it possible that a bright, gay creature like
Bee, with hundreds of thousands at her command, would
go with him to those islands in the far-off Pacific, but he
nevertheless asked her the question, and her answer,
given tearfully and sadly, and rather as a refusal of the
Feejees than of himself, scattered the sweetest dream of
his life, and with a new-made grave in his heart he went
back to Bronson on a matter of business he had with Mr.
Brown. That he should take a wife with him seemed a
necessity, and as Mary was ready, and more than willing,
and he cared little now who it was, so that she was good
and true and pure, he married her with no love in his
heart for her, only a great respect, and a registered vow
that she should receive from him everything but love,
and if it were possible, should never feel the absence of
that. And she had not, for he had kept his vow religiously,
and only when he gave the name to Trixey had
she experienced a little prick of jealousy, and felt curious
with regard to the original Beatrice. If he did not
choose to tell her of the lady she would not ask, and so
knew nothing till she met her in New York, and was
dazzled and bewildered, and troubled, and a very little
annoyed at first, and finally won by the sparkling, brilliant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>woman who had done so much for her, and who
now stood offering to take Trixey off her hands and save
her from Mrs. Hayden. She knew she could trust her,
and that Trix would be safe with her, but she shrank
from parting with the helpful, motherly child, who did
so much for her and the baby, and she hesitated in her
answer, and said at last she would see what Theodore
would say.</p>

<p class='c011'>Theodore approved the plan heartily, if Trixey must
go somewhere to be out of the sick grandmother’s and
Aunt Nancy’s way. But now there arose trouble in
an unexpected quarter. Trixey herself demurred. She
loved the pretty lady, and was interested to hear about
the dolls and dresses, and the cats and kittens, and pretty
little tea-set and table, and wash-tub, and flat-iron,
which should all be hers in that new home in Ohio. The
wash-tub, and flat-iron, and tea-set made her waver a
little, till she glanced at Bunchie, when, with quivering
lip, she said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“What good to have ever so many sings, and Bunchie
not with me to see me use the flat-iron and was-tub,
and sit at the other end of the table when I makes the
tea?”</p>

<p class='c011'>This was the ground she took. Bunchie would not
be there to share her happiness, and she did not swerve
from it until her father appealed to her sense of right,
and told her the real reason why she should go. Grandpa’s
house was very small, and he was poor. Grandma
was sick, and Aunt Nancy could not have so many children
round.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But I could help her lots. I’d rock baby brudder
to seep, and wipe the dishes ever so many times, and be
so good and still as Bunchie,” pleaded the little girl;
but she was persuaded at last to go because it was right,
and God would love her if she did, and take care of
Bunchie and baby brother, and in the summer she should
come and see them in the old home; and so it was quite
settled that Trixey was to go with Beatrice, who felt
more and more the wisdom of the decision when that
very afternoon she met Mrs. Hayden herself in Mrs.
Morton’s room, and had an opportunity of judging what
manner of person she was, and what Trixey’s chance for
happiness would have been with her.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>She was a tall, large, finely-formed woman, with great
black eyes, bushy eyebrows, and a growth of hair about
her wide mouth which gave her a more masculine appearance
even than did her figure and size. She spoke
loudly and decidedly, as one used to her own way, as
well as to dictate the way of others. Her dress was
very rich and showy, but not <em>New-Yorkey</em> a bit, Bee decided,
after a rapid survey of the lady, who scrutinized
her as closely, and decided that she <em>was</em> New-Yorkey,
and wondered who her dressmaker was. To faded, plain
Mrs. Morton she was very patronizing and frank, and
told her that what she wanted was fresh air, and cold
baths, and oatmeal to bring her up again, while her
mother, who had been sick so long, needed effort and
energy. She could get up if she only thought so.
Nervous prostration was not a disease; it was a fancy,
which, if indulged in, would end in one’s being bed-ridden.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ve made it a rule to guard against nervousness in
every form, and what is the result? I have never been
sick a day in my life, and have no idea how it feels to
have the headache, or the toothache, or the backache, or,
in fact, any ache, and that is the way it should be.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She looked the woman never to have an ache or
pain, or if she had, to strangle it at once, and Beatrice
shrank from her involuntarily as from an Amazon, while
poor, sick Mrs. Morton colored scarlet, and roused in
defense of her own ailments, which Mrs. Hayden seemed
to think she could help.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Just because you’ve never been sick, Julia,” she
said, “you cannot understand it in others, but you go
out a missionary once, and have four children in six
years, and be as poor as poor can be, and you might
know something of aches and pains, and have some
weaknesses which cold baths and oatmeal could not
cure.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I would not go out as a missionary, and I would not
have the four children in six years; so you see it is not a
supposable case,” Mrs. Hayden retorted, and then Bee
hated her, and was doubly glad that little Trix was not
to fall into her hands.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Hayden herself was not sorry. She had made
the offer from a sense of duty, for she was high up in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>everything of that kind, and performed her duties
rigidly, from dieting her husband, a weak, feeble man,
on oatmeal and pearl barley, to telling her neighbors
their faults, and how they could amend them. She did
not like children, and it had cost her something to make
up her mind to have one in her house; but she had made
the offer, and meant to stand by it if it should be
accepted. Finding it convenient just then to visit New
York, she had called upon her poor relations to learn the
result of her offer, and when told what it was she
expressed no regret, but asked many question about Miss
Belknap, who seemed to her to be crazy to think of taking
Trixey. Suddenly there flashed upon her the recollection
of a rumor heard years ago, and, in her usual
brusque way, she asked:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is she the girl to whom Theo was once engaged,
and who jilted him?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They never were engaged, but he liked her,” Mrs.
Morton answered faintly, while a throb of neuralgic
pain shot through her head, and a bright red spot burned
on her cheeks.</p>

<p class='c011'>She was far more a lady, in her brown alpaca dressing-gown,
than was this blunt women in her velvet and
silk; and so Beatrice thought when she came in immediately
after her identity with Theo’s first love had been
proved. Mrs. Hayden never acknowledged any person
her superior, but she saw at a glance that Miss Belknap
was <em>somebody</em>, and an <em>important</em> somebody, too, and
thought to stamp herself as somebody, by talking of her
house, and grounds, and servants, and the watering-places
she frequented, and the people she had met. She
was now stopping on Madison avenue with Mrs. Sniffe,
who was Mr. Hayden’s cousin; probably Miss Belknap
knew Mrs. Sniffe, or at least had heard of her. She
attended Dr. Adams’ church, and was quite a leader
there.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<em>Do</em> you know her?” she asked squarely; and Bee
replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I have some acquaintance with Mrs. Sniffe. I
meet her occasionally at parties.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Something in the tone made Mrs. Hayden look suspiciously
at Beatrice, as she wondered whether it was Mrs.
Sniffe who was only to be met at general parties, or Miss
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>Belknap herself; while Mrs. Morton felt emboldened to
say:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mrs. Sniffe,—that’s the woman we met at Arnold’s
who called me a frump. Maybe she forgets that she
once worked in the factory at Lowell.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She had fired her heavy gun, and felt better for it, inasmuch
as she had hit the enemy, who reddened, as she
replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I believe she was there for a short time, but honest
labor does not hurt a person in this country.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then she talked of Mrs. Sniffe’s grandeur and style,
until Bee was tired of it and arose to go, promising to
call next day and decide when to take Trixey. Mrs.
Hayden followed her into the hall, and, begging her
pardon, asked who made the dress she was wearing.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mademoiselle Verwest made it and sent it to me.
Her address is No.——, Rue St. Honoré, Paris,” Bee
replied.</p>

<p class='c011'>And, somewhat discomfited, Mrs. Hayden bowed her
thanks, and returned to her cousin, whom she badgered
about her weak nerves, and want of energy, until the
poor woman burst into an uncontrollable fit of weeping,
and cried herself sick.</p>

<p class='c011'>Beatrice found her in bed next day, and as the little
room seemed so close and full of children, she carried
Trixey away with her to her friend’s house, and for a
day or two devoted herself wholly to the child, who was
kept in such a state of surprise and bewilderment that
she did not once cry for the mother down on Eighth
street. Beatrice bought her a doll nearly as large as
herself, and bought her a kitchen, with wash-tub and
stove, and a China tea-set and table, and beautiful
dresses for herself, and then whisked her off to the
train before she had time to recover from the excitement
of so many wonderful things. Mr. Morton was at
the depot, but Trixey did not see him. It was thought
better that she should not, so he looked his farewell
from a distance, but said good-by to Beatrice, and held
her hand closely pressed in his own, as he said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“God bless you, Bee, for all you have done for us.
We never can forget it. Good-by. You will, of course,
write to Mollie as soon as you get home.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, certainly,” Beatrice said, hating herself because
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>the name Mollie as spoken by Theo grated on her
nerves, and seemed in some way a wrong to herself.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bee knew such feelings were foolish, and as often as
they rose within her, she took Trix in her lap and kissed
her, and talked to her of the mother they were leaving
so far behind, and whose eyes looked at her through the
child’s, save that Trixey’s were larger, and more weird
in their expression.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was late in the afternoon when they reached Rothsay,
and were driven to Elm Park. Bee had telegraphed
to Aunt Rachel that she was coming with a little girl, so
everything was in readiness for them, and Trixey was
made much of, and talked to and looked at, until she
began to nod in her chair, and was taken up to bed.</p>

<p class='c011'>That evening Everard came up to Elm Park with
Rosamond. They had just heard of Bee’s return, and
hastened at once to see her. Everard was looking about
the same as when Beatrice saw him last, except that he
was perhaps a little thinner. He was working pretty
hard, he said, and earning some money, but his dress did
not indicate anything like reckless expenditure upon
himself, and Beatrice felt sure that Josephine was drawing
heavily upon him.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was now quite at home at the Forrest House, and
was there nearly every evening, and Beatrice felt something
like a throb of fear when she saw his eyes resting
upon Rossie, as if loth to leave the fresh young face,
which had grown so bright and attractive during the last
few months. She was growing very pretty, and her
figure looked graceful and womanly when at last she
arose to go, and stood while Everard folded her shawl
around her, drawing it close up about her neck so as to
shield her throat, which was a little sore. Something in
that shawl adjustment and the length of time it took
sent another thrill through Bee’s nerves, and the moment
they were gone she went to her room, where Trixey lay
sleeping, and bending over the child, wondered if in all
lives things got as terribly mixed as they were in hers
and Everard’s.</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
Trixey did not thrive well in her new home,
though everything which human ingenuity
could devise was done to make her happy
and contented. But in spite of everything
Trixey could not quite overcome her homesickness.
Many times a day she disappeared from sight
and was gone a long time, and when she came back there
was a mysterious redness about her eyes, which she said,
by way of explanation, were “kind of sore, she dessed.
Maybe she had got some dust in ’em.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This went on for weeks, until at last, in a fit of remorse
lest she had been guilty of a lie, the conscientious
child burst out:</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Tain’t dust, ’tain’t sore that makes ’em red; it’s
wantin’ to see papa, and mamma, and Bunchie, and baby
brudder. Was it a lie, and is I a naughty dirl to make
breve it was dust?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Bee felt that it would be wrong to keep her
any longer, and wrote to Mrs. Morton to that effect.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Morton and Bunchie were still in Bronson, but
Theo was supplying a vacant pulpit in Boston, and only
saw his wife once in two or three weeks. There was
room in the parsonage now for homesick Trixey, for the
sickly baby had died suddenly with cholera infantum,
and the same letter which carried the news to Beatrice
asked that Trixey might be sent to Vermont.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Send her by express,” Mrs. Morton wrote, “or will
you bring her yourself? We shall be so glad to see you,
though we cannot offer you a bed here, we are so full,
but there is a good country hotel near us, and Cousin
Julia Hayden, whom you met in New York, wishes me
to say that she will be very glad to entertain you at her
own house. I hope you will come, for though our acquaintance
is so recent, you seem to me like a friend of
years, and I feel that the sight of you may do me good,
now that my heart is so sore with the loss of my baby.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll go,” Bee said, as she finished reading the letter,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>deciding all the more readily on account of a little incident
which had occurred the night before, and which
filled her with alarm for both Everard and Rosamond.</p>

<p class='c011'>They had walked together to Elm Park, and sat with
her for an hour or more on the piazza, where the full
moon was shining brightly. This time there had been
no shawl to adjust, for the early June night was warm
and balmy, but there was a slight dampness in the air,
and Everard’s solicitude lest Rosamond should take cold
or contract a sore throat was noticeable in the extreme.
Two or three times he pulled the fleecy cloud of Berlin
wool about her neck, and asked if she were quite comfortable,
and once he let his hand rest on her shoulder
for some minutes, while he sat looking at her with an
expression on his face which Josephine might have resented
had she seen it. And Bee, with her strong sense
of right and wrong, resented it for her, or rather for
Rosamond, whom she would not see sacrificed without a
protest. So when they arose to go home, she led Everard
away from Rossie, and when sure she could not be
heard, said to him, earnestly:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pardon me, Everard, but you are altogether too
solicitous about Rosamond’s health. Let her take care
of herself. She is capable of doing it, and, remember,
there are bounds you must not pass, or suffer her to
approach. It would be very cruel to her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I know,” he answered, coloring deeply as he
spoke. “You need not fear for Rossie. She is my
sister, nothing more; and even if I were disposed to
make her something else, do you suppose I can ever forget
the past?”</p>

<p class='c011'>He spoke bitterly, and showed plainly how gladly he
would free himself, if possible, from the bond which
held him, and which was growing daily more and more
hateful to him.</p>

<p class='c011'>As far as she could see them in the moonlight Beatrice
watched Everard and Rossie as they walked slowly
down the avenue which led to the street, and when they
were out of sight she said to herself: “He ought to acknowledge
his marriage, and he must, even if he does
not take his wife, which might be the better thing to do.
There must be good in her,—something to build upon, if
under the right influence, with somebody to encourage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>and stimulate her to do her best. I wish I knew her,—wish
I dared face her in her own home, and judge what
kind of person she is.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This was Bee’s thought the night before she read
Mrs. Morton’s letter inviting her to Bronson, and when
she read it the thought resolved itself into a fixed purpose,
the first step of which was to take Trixey to her
mother. Poor little Trixey, who turned so white, but did
not at first shed a tear, when told of her baby brother’s
death. Half an hour later, however, Beatrice found her
in the garden, with her face in the grass, sobbing as if
her heart would break for the dead brother, of whom
she said to Bee, “I wouldn’t feel so bad to have him
with Jesus, only I shaked him once hard, when he was so
cross and heavy, and I was so tired, and he wouldn’t go
to sleep. I’se so sorry. Will God let me go to Heaven
some day and see him, and tell him I’se sorry?”</p>

<p class='c011'>As well as she could, Beatrice comforted and reassured
the weeping child, whose conscientiousness and
sweet faith and trust in God were leading her into ways
she had only known in theory, but which were beginning
to be very pleasant to her feet, as she learned
each day some new lesson from the trusting child.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was near the latter part of June, the season of
roses, and pinks, and water lilies in New England, when
she at last took Trixey to the old brown house under the
shadow of the apple trees, where the mountain air was
filled with perfume from the flowers blossoming on the
borders by the door, and where Bunchie played in the
soft summer sunshine under the snow-ball tree by the
well. It was such a plain, but pleasant old house, with
the rafters overhead showing in the kitchen, and the
great box-like beams in the corners of the room,—for
the old house claimed to have seen a hundred years,
and to have heard the guns of the Revolution.
But it was very cheerful and home-like,
and neat as soap and sand and Aunt Nancy’s
hands could make it. Aunt Nancy was the first to welcome
Miss Belknap, looking a little askance at her style
and manners, and wondering how they could ever entertain
so fine a lady even for a few hours. Mrs. Morton
was sick with a headache, and Mrs. Brown was still
down with nervous prostration, having stoutly resisted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>all Mrs. Julia Hayden’s advice about making an effort,
and hints which sometimes amounted to assertions that
she could get up if she liked, and would diet on oatmeal
and barley. In her last letter to Mrs. Morton, Beatrice
had declined Mrs. Hayden’s offer, and said she should
feel more independent at the hotel for the short time she
should remain in Bronson, but within half an hour after
her arrival at the parsonage, Mrs. Hayden was there
also, in her handsome carriage, drawn by her shining black
horses, and driven by a shining black coachman, in
gloves and brass buttons, and she insisted so hard upon
Beatrice stopping with her, that the latter finally accepted
the invitation, but said she would remain for the
day where she was and see if she could not be of some
comfort and help to Mrs. Morton, who seemed better
from the moment she came and laid her soft hands on
her head.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nothing can help her or her mother, either, unless
they make an effort,” Mrs. Hayden said, with a toss of
her head, and a flash of her black eyes. “Spleeny and
notional both of them as they can be; call it nervous,
if you like; what’s nervousness but fidgets? I was
never nervous; but if I’d give up every time the weather
changes, or I felt a little weak, I might have prostration,
too. There’s Harry, my husband, would have died long
ago if I had not kept him up just by my own energy and
will. I make him sleep with the windows open, and he
takes a cold bath every morning at six o’clock, and eats
oatmeal for his breakfast, with a cup of hot water
instead of coffee or tea.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And does he thrive on that diet? Is he well and
strong?” Bee asked, and Mrs. Hayden replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well and strong? No: he could not be that in
the nature of things, he comes from a sickly stock;
but he keeps about, which is better than lying in bed and
moping all the time.”</p>

<p class='c011'>How strong and full of life Mrs. Hayden was, and so
unsympathetic that Beatrice did not wonder Mrs. Morton
shivered and shrank away even from the touch of
her large, powerful hands.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am sometimes wicked enough to wish she might
be sick herself, or at least nervous, so as to know how it
feels,” Mrs. Morton said, after her cousin had gone.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>“She thinks I can do as she does, and the thing is impossible.
My health is destroyed, and I sometimes fear I
shall never be well again.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She had failed since Beatrice saw her, and her eyes
looked so large and glassy as she lay upon the pillow,
and her cough was so constant and irritating, that to
talk of effort and oatmeal to her seemed preposterous
and cruel. What she needed was rest, and nursing, and
care, and change of thought and occupation, and these
she could not have in their fullest extent at the parsonage,
with poverty and a sick mother, and bustling, irritable
Aunt Nancy to act as counter influences. She must
be taken entirely away, and amused, and nursed, and petted,
and Beatrice began to see the first step of that vague
plan formed in Rothsay, and which she meant to carry
out.</p>

<p class='c011'>For a day or two she staid in Bronson, sleeping and
eating in Mrs. Hayden’s grand house, and feeling all her
sympathies enlisted for shriveled-up Mr. Hayden, who
in the morning came shivering to the table from his cold
bath, and swallowed his oatmeal and hot water dutifully,
but with an expression on his thin, sallow face which
showed how his stomach rebelled against it and craved
the juicy steak and fragrant coffee with which his blooming
wife regaled herself, because she was strong and
could bear it. Once Bee ventured to suggest that steak
and beef-tea might be a more nutritious diet even for a
dyspeptic than oatmeal and barley, varied with dry
toast and baked apples; but Mrs. Hayden <em>knew</em>. She
had read up on <em>stomachs</em>, and <em>nerves</em>, and <em>digestion</em>, and
knew every symptom of dyspepsia, and its cause, and
what it needed, and how a person ought to feel; and her
husband submitted quietly, and said, “Julie was right,”
and grew thinner, and paler, and weaker every day with
cold baths and starvation; but he kept the respect of
his wife because he <em>tried</em> to be well, and that was a great
thing to do, for in his estimation she was a wonderful
woman, and represented the wisdom of the world.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the third day Beatrice left Bronson, to look,
she said, for some quiet, pleasant nook, where she
could spend a few weeks during the hot weather. She
found such a place in Holburton, whither she came one
warm July afternoon, when the town was at its best. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>was not an unheard-of thing for city people to pass a
few weeks in Holburton during the hot weather, and no
one was surprised when Miss Belknap registered her
name on the hotel books, and said she was looking for
some quiet and reasonable boarding-house for an invalid
with two children. Several were recommended to her,
and with the list in her hand she started out to reconnoiter.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Roxie Fleming was the fourth name on her paper,
but she went there first, and was pleased with the
place at once, because it looked so cool and inviting under
the wealth of hop vines which covered one side of it.</p>

<p class='c011'>The day was warm, and Mrs. Fleming, in her clean
purple calico gown, sat sewing on the door-steps, while
a woman with a deep pasteboard bonnet on her head,
concealing her face from view, was sweeping the grass
in the back yard. But she turned as she heard the gate
open, and seeing Beatrice, came forward until she saw her
mother; then she withdrew, leaving Mrs. Fleming to confer
with the stranger.</p>

<p class='c011'>She had rooms to let, she said; did the lady wish
them for herself? and she looked curiously at Beatrice,
who was so different from the boarders who usually came
to her, for her rooms were low and scantily furnished,
and not at all like the apartments city people desired.</p>

<p class='c011'>Miss Belknap wanted board for herself and a friend
with two children; two sleeping-rooms and a parlor
would do nicely for them all, and she was willing to pay
whatever it was worth.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Fleming readily guessed that money was no
consideration with the lady, and as it was of much importance
to her, she decided to ask the highest possible
price at first, and then fall if necessary. After a moment,
during which she seemed to be thinking, she said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t know but I can accommodate you with three
rooms, though I do not often rent an extra parlor, and if
I do so now my daughter Josephine must give up the
room she occupies when she is here.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then she is not at home?” Beatrice said, feeling
that she must know that fact before she engaged board,
where the only attraction was Josephine who, she found,
had only gone for a week or so to Oak Bluffs, with a
party of friends, and was expected daily.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>The price named for the three rooms, though high
for Holburton, did not seem unreasonable to Beatrice,
and the bargain was closed with the understanding that
Beatrice was to take immediate possession.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It will be a change for Mrs. Morton; a relief to
Aunt Nancy; a possible benefit to Everard, and an
amusement to me,” Beatrice thought, as she hurried back
to Bronson, where she found the Rev. Theodore himself,
handsomer, more elegant in appearance, because
better dressed, than when she saw him last, and very
glad to see her, as an old friend who was kind to his wife
and children.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the Holburton plan he listened approvingly. It
would do Mollie good, he said, for two sick people in
one house were quite too many for the comfort of either.
But Mollie demurred; she could not sleep in new places
unless everything were right, and she presumed there
were swarms of crickets and tree-toads, and possibly
bull-frogs, there among the mountains, to make the
night hideous.</p>

<p class='c011'>It would be impossible to portray the scorn and disgust
which blazed in the black eyes of Mrs. Julia Hayden,
who was present, when Mollie uttered her protest
against Holburton.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Crickets, and tree-toads, and bull-frogs, indeed!
She’d like to see the bull-frog which could keep her
awake, even if it sat on her pillow and croaked in her
ear; it was all nonsense, such fidgets. Just use your
will and a little common sense, and you will sleep
through everything.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This was Mrs. Hayden’s theory, which made Mollie
cry and Beatrice angry, and Theodore laugh. He
had to stand between them all, and keep them from
quarreling, and he did it admirably, and smoothed
everything so nicely, and made the trip to Holburton
seem so desirable, that Mollie began to want to go,
especially as he assured her he could well afford it,
as the church in Boston paid him liberally, and had
just given him a hundred dollars to do with as he liked.
Beatrice had intended to meet the expenses herself, but
could not press the matter without hurting more than
she did good. It was just possible that Mrs. Hayden
might follow them with her husband, if good rooms and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>board could be found for her, for she had taken a great
liking to Miss Belknap, who stood even higher in her
estimation than Mrs. Sniffe, and whose acquaintance she
readily saw would do her more real good in a social
point of view. So it was finally arranged that Mollie
and the children should go to Holburton for the summer,
and word to that effect was forwarded to Mrs. Fleming,
with instructions to have the rooms in readiness by the
middle of July.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXV.<br> <span class='large'>MRS. FLEMING’S BOARDERS.</span></h2>
</div>

<div class='c010'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/di_203.jpg' width='100' alt=''>
</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
It was a lovely summer day when the party
arrived at Holburton and were driven to the
brown house on the common, where they
found everything in readiness for them, and
Mrs. Fleming and Agnes waiting to receive
them. Josephine was not visible, for she had resolutely
set her face against them.</p>

<p class='c011'>She did not want a lot of women in the house any
way, she said; they were a nuisance, and made as much
again trouble as men. They were never satisfied with
their board, were always in the kitchen washing out
their pocket-handkerchiefs, heating flat-irons and making
a muss generally. For her part, she liked to be free to
do as she liked without the fear of being torn into shoestrings
by some meddling, jealous old woman. If they
must have boarders, take gentlemen; there were plenty
who would be glad to come. She would rather have
clerks, or even mechanics, than the fine lady they described
and a sick woman with her brats, and blue as a
whetstone undoubtedly, inasmuch as she was a missionary’s
wife. She’d be wanting family prayers and a
blessing at the table, and be horrified to know there were
two packs of cards in the house, and that they were
used, too!</p>

<p class='c011'>This was Josephine’s opinion, but her mother had her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>way in spite of it, and went on with her preparations,
while Josephine sulked, and declared her intention of
avoiding them entirely, and never, in any way, coming
in contact with them. Still, there was a consolation in
the fact that the small room she was compelled to take
was down stairs, and so far removed from the boarders
that they would not know how late she was out
on the street with admirers, of which she had several,
or how long they staid with her after she came in.
Josephine liked the kind of life she was leading at
present. No lady in town dressed better than she did,
and though she knew that people commented upon it,
and wondered where she got the money, and hinted at
things which no real modest woman would like to have
laid to her charge, she did not care, so long as she knew
it was all right, and that some day everything would
be explained, and she stand acquitted before the world,
which criticised her unmercifully, but because there
was no tangible proof against her, noticed her just the
same as if there were no breath of suspicion attaching
to her name. She <em>would</em> be noticed, and if she saw
signs of rebellion in any quarter she fought it down inch
by inch and rode triumphantly over the opinions of those
who tried to slight her. No young lady in town could
boast as many admirers as she, and she managed to keep
them at her side even after they found there was no
hope. Old Captain Sparks, the millionaire, had long
known this, and yet, as the moth flutters around the candle,
so he hovered around the young beauty, accepting
the position of father instead of brother, and from time
to time presenting his <em>daughter</em> with costly presents,
which she accepted so sweetly and prettily because she
knew it would hurt him if she refused. To the other
lovers she was <em>sister</em> and friend, and she gave them a
great deal of good advice, and made them believe they
were much safer with her than they would be elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c011'>Only Dr. Matthewson knew her thoroughly, and him
she never tried to deceive. And still, the doctor was
more absolutely under her influence than any of the
train who visited her constantly. But just now he was
away on <em>business</em>, he called it, though Josephine knew
that the business was gambling, that being his only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>means of livelihood. A fortunate play, or series of
plays, had put a large sum of money into his hands, and
he had gone on a sailing vessel to the West Indies,
thinking to visit England before returning to America.
Josephine was a little <em>ennuyeed</em> without the doctor, whom
she preferred to any man living. And yet, could she
have had him by giving up Everard she would not have
done it, for though she had no love for her husband, she
had a fancy for the money and position he could give
her by and by, and for which she was patiently waiting.
Had her life been less pleasant and exciting, or had
Everard sent her less money, she might have rebelled
against it, and taken steps which would have resulted in
her learning the state of affairs at the Forrest House.
But as it was she was content to wait and enjoy herself
in her own way, which was to dress and flirt, and come
and go at her pleasure, and be waited on at home as if
she were some princess of the blood.</p>

<p class='c011'>And this was about the state of affairs when Beatrice
reached the Fleming house with Mrs. Morton, who, contrary
to her expectations, was pleased at once.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do believe I shall rest here and get well again,
everything is so comfortable,” she said, as she lay down
upon the chintz-covered lounge for a few moments
before taking the cup of tea which was brought to
her by Agnes, who, in her clean calico dress, with her
dark hair combed smoothly back, and a sad but peaceful
expression on her white, tired face, enlisted Beatrice’s
sympathies at once, for she saw from her manner that she
was a mere household drudge, and resolved to stand her
friend whatever might come.</p>

<p class='c011'>Agnes was very fond of children, and when she had
arranged the tray for Mrs. Morton, she turned to the
little ones and tried to coax them to her side. Bunchie
came at once, but Trixey held aloof, and, with her hands
behind her, watched the woman curiously, and it would
seem without a very complimentary verdict in her favor.
Trixey was fond of bright, gay colors and elegant apparel.
Beatrice’s style suited her better than this faded,
spiritless woman, whom she, nevertheless, regarded very
intently, and at last startled with the question:</p>

<p class='c011'>“How did you look when you were new?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Trixey!” Mrs. Morton and Beatrice both exclaimed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>in a breath, fearing lest Agnes’ feelings should
be hurt, but she only laughed a hearty, merry laugh,
which changed her face completely, and made it almost
young and pretty, as she said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t know how I looked, it was so very long ago;
but I love little girls like you, and my old black hands
have made them so many pies and cakes, and paper dollies,
and they shall make some for you, if you’ll let me
kiss you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Trixey was won by this, and when Agnes went back
to the kitchen she was followed by both the children,
who were intent upon the little cakes she had made that
morning in expectation of their coming.</p>

<p class='c011'>Josephine had watched the arrival of the ladies
through the half-closed shutters, deciding that Mrs. Morton
was a dowdy country woman, and that Miss Belknap
was very elegant even in her plain traveling dress,
and that, perhaps, she was somebody whom it would be
policy to cultivate. But she would not present herself
that afternoon; she was tired, and wished to keep herself
fresh for evening, when she expected a call from a young
man from Albany, whose mother had taken rooms at the
hotel for the summer, and whom she had met at a picnic
the day before.</p>

<p class='c011'>The next day was Sunday, and though breakfast was
served later than usual, Josephine was later still, and the
meal was nearly half over when she entered the room,
attired in a blue cambric gown, with gold pendants in
her ears, and a bit of honeysuckle at her throat. There
was a very sweet, apologetic expression on her face as
she went up to her mother and <em>kissed</em> her good morning,
saying, coaxingly:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Late again, as usual, mamma, but you must excuse
me. I was so sleepy;” then, with a graceful recognition
of the strangers, she took her seat at the table by the
side of Trixey, whom she patted on the head, saying:
“And how is the little girl, this morning?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Fleming was accustomed to all manner of moods
and freaks in her daughter, but the kissing was something
new, and surprised her a little, especially as there
were no gentlemen present to witness the pretty, childish
scene. She passed it off, however, naturally enough,
and introducing her daughter to the ladies went on serving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>the breakfast. Agnes waited upon the table, and so
there was no kiss for her, only a gracious nod and a
“good morning, sister,” as if this was their first meeting,
when, in fact, Agnes had been in and out of Josephine’s
room three or four times, carrying hot water, and
towels, and soap. But Agnes was accustomed to such
things and made no sign, except as a slight flush passed
across her pale face, which was unobserved by Beatrice,
who was giving all her attention to the young beauty,
sipping her coffee so leisurely, and saying pretty things
to Trixey.</p>

<p class='c011'>How beautiful she was, with those great dreamy blue
eyes, those delicately chiseled features, and that dazzling
complexion, which Bee thought at first must be artificial,
it was so pure, and white, and smooth. But she was
mistaken, for Josephine’s complexion had never known
powder or paste, or wash of any kind. It was very brilliant
and fresh, and she looked so young, and innocent,
and child-like that Beatrice found it hard to believe
there was aught of guile or deceit in her. Everard must
have become morbidly sensitive to any faults she might
have, and Bee’s thoughts were at once busy with what
she meant to do for this estranged couple. There must
be much of good in her. Surely that face and those
eyes, which looked so confidingly at you, could not cover
a bad heart. Weak, and vain, and faulty she might be,
but not bad; not treacherous and unwomanly, as Everard
believed, and Beatrice was so glad she had come there
to see and judge for herself. Every action was perfectly
lady-like, every movement graceful, while the voice was
soft and low, and well-bred in its tone; and during the
few moments they talked together after breakfast,
Beatrice felt herself fascinated as she had never been
before by any human being. As she was tired, and had
a slight headache, she did not go to church that morning,
but saw Josephine leave the house, and watched her
out of sight with feelings of wonder and perplexity.
Could this be the woman whom Everard regarded with
so much disgust? the Joe Fleming whom she had
thought so detestable? Nor was her wonder at all diminished
when, that afternoon, she found Josephine in
the garden, seated under a tree with Bunchie in her lap
and Trixey at her side, listening intently while she told
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>them the story of Moses in the bulrushes. They had
heard it before, but it gained new power and interest
when told in Josephine’s dramatic way, and they hung
on every word, and when it was done begged her for another.
Surely, here was more of the angel than the
fiend, and Beatrice, too, sat down, charmed in spite of
herself with the girl she had expected to despise.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She must be good, and Everard is surely mistaken,”
she thought, and her admiration was at its height when
Josephine finished her stories and began to talk to her.
Mrs. Fleming had received an impression that Miss Belknap
was from New York, and Josephine began to question
her of that city, asking if she had always lived
there.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I was born there,” Beatrice replied, “but I was educated
in Paris, and my home is really in Rothsay, a little
town in southern Ohio.”</p>

<p class='c011'>At the mention of Rothsay Josephine started, and
there was an increase of color in her face, but otherwise
she was very calm, and her voice was perfectly natural
as she repeated the word Rothsay, evidently trying to
recall something connected with that place. At last she
succeeded, and said, “Rothsay—Rothsay, in Ohio. Why,
that is where Mr. Forrest lives. Mr. J. Everard Forrest,
Jr. He boarded with mamma two or three years ago.
He was in college at Amherst. Probably you know
him,” and the blue eyes looked very innocently at
Beatrice, who, warned by the perfect acting to be cautious
and guarded, replied, “Oh, yes, I know Everard
Forrest. His mother was a distant relative of mine.
She is dead. Did you know?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think I heard so. Everard was very fond of his
mother,” Josephine said; then, after a pause she added,
“Judge Forrest is very wealthy, and very aristocratic,
isn’t he?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He was always called so, and the Forrest property
is said to be immense,” Beatrice replied, quieting her
conscience with the fact that, so far as the judge was
concerned, she had put him in the past tense, and spoken
of what he was <em>once</em> rather than of what he was at
<em>present</em>, but Josephine paid no attention to tenses, and
had no suspicion whatever of the truth.</p>

<p class='c011'>She was really a good deal startled and shaken, mentally,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>notwithstanding the calmness of her demeanor.
Here was a person from Rothsay who knew Everard
Forrest, and who might be of great service to her in
the future, and it behooved her to be on her best behavior.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is Everard married yet?” she asked after a moment.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Married?” Beatrice repeated, and she felt the color
rising in her face. “Why, he has not his profession yet,
but is studying very hard in his father’s office.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, yes, I remember, he intended to be a lawyer. I
liked him very much, he was so pleasant and gentlemanly,”
Josephine said, and there was a drooping of the
heavy lashes over her blue eyes, as if with regret for the
past, when she knew and liked Everard Forrest.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But is there no one to whom he is particularly attentive?”
she asked. “He used to be very fond of the
girls, and there most be some one in Rothsay suitable
for him, or is his father so proud that he would object to
everybody?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Beatrice knew perfectly well what Josephine meant,
and answered that she had heard the judge was very
particular, and would resent a marriage which he thought
beneath his son, “but if the woman was good, and true,
and pure, and did her best, I think it would all be well
in time,” she added, as an encouragement to this girl
in whom she was trying to believe; and Josephine continued:</p>

<p class='c011'>“He used to speak of a little girl, Rosamond, I think,
was the name. She must be well grown by this time.
Is she there now?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You mean Rossie Hastings, his adopted sister. Yes,
she is there still, and a very nice, womanly little thing.
She is sixteen, I believe, though she seems to me
younger,” Beatrice said, and the impression left on Josephine’s
mind of Rossie was of a child, in whom Everard
could not be greatly interested except in a brotherly
way.</p>

<p class='c011'>She had made all the inquiries she cared to make just
then, lest she should excite suspicion in Beatrice, and
was meditating a retreat, when the sound of rapid wheels
reached them, and a moment after a tall, slender young
man, not over twenty, came down the walk flourishing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>his little cane and showing plainly the half-fledged boy,
who was beginning to feel all the independence and
superiority of a man. Bowing very low to Beatrice, to
whom he was introduced as Mr. Gerard from Albany, he
told Josephine he had come to ask her to drive after his
fast horse. “You were at church all the morning, and
deserve a little recreation,” he said, as he saw signs of
refusal in Josey, who, sure that Miss Belknap would not
accept a like invitation felt that she, too, must refuse; so
she said very sweetly and a little reprovingly:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you, Mr. Gerard, but I do not often ride on
Sunday. Some other day I shall be happy to go with
you, for I dote on fast horses, but now you must excuse
me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Young Gerard was surprised, for he had not expected
to find conscientious scruples in the girl who the previous
night, had played euchre with him until half-past eleven,
and then stood another half hour at the gate, laughing
and flirting with him, though she had met him but once
before.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was not accustomed to be thwarted, and he
showed that he was annoyed, and answered loftily:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Certainly, do as you think best. If you won’t ride
with me, I must find somebody who will. I wish you
good-afternoon, ladies.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Touching his hat very politely he walked away; but
Josephine could not let him go in this mood. He was
her latest conquest, and she arose and followed him, and
walked with him to the gate, and said to him apologetically:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I want to go awfully, but it will never do with a
missionary’s family in the house.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Bother take the missionaries,” he said. “I wanted
to show you how fast Dido can trot.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I know; but there are other days than Sunday,
and there are lots of girls aching to go with you to-day,”
Josephine said, as she fastened a little more securely the
bouquet in his button-hole, and let her hands rest longer
on his coat-sleeve than was necessary.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But I shan’t take ’em. I shall wait for you,” he
answered, quite soothed and mollified.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then he bade her good-by, and drove off, while
Josephine returned to Beatrice and said, laughingly:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>“What bores boys of a certain age are, and how they
always fasten upon a girl older than themselves! This
Gerard cannot be over twenty. He reminds me a little
in his dress of Everard Forrest when he first came here,
so fastidious and elegant, as if he had just stepped from
a bandbox.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He is very different from that now,” Beatrice replied,
rousing up at once in Everard’s defense. “Of
course he can never look like anything but a gentleman,
but he wears his coats and boots and hats until they are
positively shabby. It would almost seem as if he were
hoarding up money for some particular purpose, he is so
careful about expense. He neither smokes, nor chews,
nor drinks, and it is said of him that he has not a single
bad habit; his wife, should he ever have one, ought to
be very proud of him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Beatrice was very eloquent and earnest in her praises
of Everard, and watched closely the effect on Josephine.
There certainly was a different, expression on her face as
she listened to this high encomium on her husband, whose
economies she well knew were practiced for her, and
there was something like a throb of gratitude or affection
in her heart when she heard that the money she had
supposed was given him by his father was earned or
saved by himself, that she might be daintily clothed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am delighted with this good account of him, and
so will mamma be,” she said; “he must have changed
so much, for he was very extravagant and reckless when
we knew him, but I liked him exceedingly.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Again there was the sound of wheels stopping before
the gate, and excusing herself, Josephine hurried away
to meet the second gallant who had come to take her to
ride. Of course she could not go, and so the young man
staid with her, and Walter Gerard drove back that way,
and seeing her in the parlor tied his horse to the fence and
came sauntering in with the air of one sure of a welcome.</p>

<p class='c011'>Josephine did not appear at the tea-table, but Beatrice
saw Agnes taking a tray into the parlor, and knew
the trio were served in there, and felt greatly shocked
and disgusted when she heard the clock strike twelve before
the sound of suppressed voices and laughter ceased
in the parlor, and the two buggies were driven rapidly
away.</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
The next day Josephine wrote Everard the
first real letter she had sent him for many
weeks. Heretofore she had merely acknowledged
his drafts made payable to her mother,
but now she filled an entire sheet, and called
him her <em>dear husband</em>, and told him of Miss Belknap’s
presence in the house, and what she had said of his
habits and strict economy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know it is all for me,” she wrote, “and I felt like
crying when she was talking about you. I am so glad
she told me, for it has made me resolve to be worthy of
you and the position I am one day to fill as your wife.
When will that be, Everard? Must we wait forever?
Sometimes I get desperate, and am tempted to start at
once for Rothsay, and, facing your father, tell him the
truth, and brave the storm which I suppose would
follow. But then I know you would be angry at such a
proceeding, and so I give it up, and go on waiting
patiently, for I do wish to please you, and am glad this
Miss Belknap is here, as I am sure of her friendship
when the time of trial comes. She is very sweet and
lovely, and I wonder you did not prefer her to your unworthy
but loving Josey.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Beatrice also wrote to Everard that day, and told
him where she was, and why, and said of Josephine,
“there must be good in her, or she could not seem so
sweet, and amiable, and affectionate. A little vain she
may be, and fond of attention, and why not? She cannot
look in the glass and not know how beautiful she is.
And her voice is so soft, and low, and musical, and her
manners so lady-like. You see I am more than half in
love with her, and I am quite disposed to advise a recognition
on your part of her claim upon you. Of course
I shall not betray you. That is not my business here. I
came to see what this girl is, whose life is joined with
yours. I find her quite up to the average of women,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>and think it your safer course to acknowledge her, and
not leave her subject to the temptations which must
necessarily beset a pretty woman like her, in the shape of
admiration and attention from every marriageable man
in town. It is your safer way, Everard, for remember
there is a bar between you and any other face which
may look to you inexpressibly fair and sweet, and all
the sweeter and fairer because possession is impossible.”</p>

<p class='c011'>These letters reached Everard the same evening, and
he found them in his office on his return from the Forrest
House, where he had sat with Rossie an hour on the
piazza, with the moonlight falling on her face and
softening the brilliancy of her great black eyes. How
beautiful those eyes were to him now, and how modestly
and confidingly they looked up occasionally in his face,
and drooped beneath the long lashes which rested on
the fair cheeks. She was so sweet and loving, this pure,
fresh young girl; and her face and eyes haunted Everard
all the way down the avenue and the long street to
his office, where he found his letters,—one from Beatrice,
one from Josephine, and this last he saw first, recoiling
from it as from a serpent’s touch, and remembering with
a bitter pain the face seen in the moonlight, and the
pressure of the hand he had held in his at parting. Then
he took Bee’s letter, and turned it over, and saw it was
postmarked at Holburton, and with a start of fear and
apprehension tore it open and read it eagerly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But I shall never do it,” he said, as he read Bee’s
advice with regard to recognizing Josephine. “The
goodness is not there; and so Bee will discover if she
stops there long enough.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, as he finished her letter, he felt as if all the
blood in his body were rushing to his head, for he
guessed what she meant by “that other face, so inexpressibly
fair and sweet.” It was Rossie’s, and he ground
his teeth together as he thought of the bar which made
it sinful for him to look too often upon that face, fast
budding into rare beauty, lest he should find it <em>too sweet</em>
and <em>fair</em> for his own peace of mind. And then he told
himself that Rosamond was only his sister; his ward, in
whom he must necessarily have an unusual interest.
Beatrice was too fastidious, and did not trust enough to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>his good sense. He was not in love with Rosamond,
nor in danger of becoming so.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus the young man reasoned, while he tore Josey’s
letter into shreds, which he tossed into the waste-basket.
He did not believe in her or intend to answer it, for
whenever he thought of her now it was as he saw her
last, at midnight in the car, sleeping on Dr. Matthewson’s
arm. He wrote to Beatrice, however, within a few
days, expressing his surprise at what she had done,—and
telling her that any interference between Josephine and
himself was useless, and that if she staid long in Holburton
she would probably change her mind with regard to
the young lady.</p>

<p class='c011'>And in this he was right, for before his letter reached
Holburton, Beatrice and Mrs. Morton both had learned
that the voice, so soft and flute-like and well-bred when
it addressed themselves, had another ring when alone in
the kitchen with Agnes, who drudged from morning
till night, that the unusually large household might be
kept up. There were more boarders now in the house,
for Mrs. Julia Hayden and husband had come to Holburton,
hoping a change would benefit Mr. Hayden, who
liked the quiet, pleasant town, and the pure air from the
hills, which was not quite so bracing as that which blew
down from the mountains around Bronson. The Haydens
occupied the parlor below, greatly to the annoyance
of Miss Josey, who was thus compelled to receive her
numerous calls either in the dining-room or on the back
piazza, or on the horse-block near the gate.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was not unusual for Josey to receive three admirers
at a time, and she managed so admirably that she kept
them all amiable and civil, though each hated the other
cordially, and wondered why he would persist in coming
where he was not wanted. Night after night Mrs. Morton
and Mr. Hayden were kept awake till after midnight
by the low hum of voices and occasional bursts of suppressed
laughter which came from the vicinity of the
horse-block, and when Mrs. Morton complained of it in
the presence of Josephine, that young lady was very
sorry, and presumed it was some of the hired girls in
town, who had a great way of hanging over gates with
their lovers, and sitting upon horse-blocks into all hours
of the night.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>But Mrs. Julia was not deceived. Her great black
eyes read the girl aright, and when she saw a female
figure steal cautiously up the walk into the house, and
heard the footsteps of two or three individuals going down
the road, she guessed <em>who</em> the “hired girls” were, and
Josephine suspected that she did, and removed her trysting-place
from the horse-block to the rear of the garden,
where she was out of ear-shot of the “old muffs,” as she
styled Mrs. Morton and Mrs. Hayden. And here she
received her <em>friends</em>, as she called them,—and laughed,
and flirted, and played with them, but was very careful
not to overstep certain bounds of propriety, and thus
give Everard an excuse on which to base an action for
divorce, should he ever bring himself to consider such an
act, which she doubted. He was too proud for that, and
would rather live with and dislike her, than repudiate
her openly, and bring a stain upon the Forrest name. It
was impossible for her to understand his real feelings
toward her. Indifferent he was, of course, and sorry, no
doubt, for the tie which bound them; but she was so
thoroughly convinced of her own charms and power to
fascinate, that she had little fear of winning him back to
something like allegiance when she once had him under
her influence again. He could not resist her; no man
could, except the old judge; and secure in this belief she
went on her way, while Beatrice watched her narrowly,
and began at last to believe there was no real good in
her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The most shameless flirt I ever saw, with claws like
a cat,” Mrs. Hayden said of her,—“why, she has actually
tried her power on Harry, and asked him so insinuatingly
and pityingly if he really thought oatmeal agreed
with him as well as a juicy steak or mutton-chop.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bee laughed merrily at the idea of Josey’s casting her
eyes upon poor, shriveled, dyspeptic Harry Hayden,
whom, to do her justice, she did pity, for the cold baths
he was compelled to take every morning, and the rigid
diet on which he was kept. That he lacked brain force,
as his wife asserted, she did not doubt, or he would
never have submitted as meekly as he did, with the stereotyped
phrase, “Julie knows best,” but she pitied him
just the same, and occasionally conveyed to him on the
sly hot cups of beef-tea or mutton-broth, and once
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>coaxed him to drink lager-beer, but Mrs. Julia found it
out by the culprit’s breath, and disliked Josey worse
than ever.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was now five weeks since Beatrice first came to
Holburton, and as Mrs. Morton did not seem to improve,
she was thinking of finding another place for her,
when Josephine came to her one morning as she was
sitting alone with her work, and, taking a seat beside her,
began to talk of herself and the life she was leading.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am of no use to any one,” she said, “for both
mother and Agnes are afraid I shall soil my hands or
burn my face. I am tired of this kind of life. I want
to see the world and have larger experiences; and fortunately
I have an opportunity to do so. When I was
at the sea-side I met a widow-lady, a Mrs. Arnold, who
is rich and an invalid. She was kind enough to pretend
to like me, and I think she did, for I have received a
letter from her, asking me to go as a companion with
her to Europe, she defraying all the expenses, of course,
and leaving me nothing to do but to make myself agreeable
to her, and enjoy what I see. Now, would you go or
not?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think I would,” Beatrice replied, for it seemed to
her as if this going to Europe would somehow be the
severing link between Everard and Josephine. Something
would happen to bring on the crisis which must
come sooner or later.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I would go, most certainly,” she said again, and then
she asked some questions concerning Mrs. Arnold, whose
letter Josey showed to her. Evidently she was not a
woman of great discernment or culture, but she was sincere
in her wish to take Josephine abroad, and disposed
to be very generous with her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She will be gone a year at least, and possibly two,
and I can see so much in that time, I am quite dizzy with
anticipation,” Josephine said, while Beatrice entered
heart and soul into the project, which was soon known
to the entire household. That night young Gerard from
Albany called on Josephine as usual, and hearing of the
proposed trip to Europe offered himself to her, and cried
like a baby when she gave him her final “no,” and made
him understand that she meant it. But she held his
hand in hers, and there was one of her tears on his boyish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>face when at last he said good-night and walked
away, somewhat soothed and comforted with the thought
that he was to be her friend of friends, the one held as
the dearest and best in her memory when she was far
over the sea.</p>

<p class='c011'>The news of the intended journey made Everard
wild with delight, for, with the ocean between them, he
felt that he should almost be free again; and he sent her
a hundred dollars, and told her he hoped she would
enjoy herself, and then, intoxicated with what seemed
to him like his freedom, went up to see Rosamond, and
staid with her until the clock was striking ten, and
Mrs. Markham came into the room to break up the <i><span lang="fr">tete-a-tete</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was the last day of August that the <em>Nova Zembla</em>
sailed out of the harbor of Boston with Josephine on
board, her fair hands waving kisses and adieux to the
two men on the shore, watching her so intently,—young
Gerard and old Captain Sparks, who had followed her
to the very last, each vieing with the other in the size
and cost of the bouquets, which filled one entire half of
a table in the dining saloon, and stamped as somebody
the beautiful girl who paraded them rather ostentatiously
before her fellow-passengers.</p>

<p class='c011'>For two days they adorned the table at which she
sat, and filled the saloon with perfume, and were examined
and talked about, and she was pointed out as
that young lady who had so many large and elegant
bouquets; and then, the third day out, when their beauty
and perfume were gone, they were thrown overboard by
the cabin-boy, and a great wave came and carried them
far out to sea, while Josey lay in her berth limp, wretched
and helpless, with no thought of flowers, or Gerard, or
Captain Sparks, but with a feeling of genuine longing
for the mother and Agnes, whose care and ministrations
she missed so much in her miserable condition.</p>

<div class='c010'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/di_218.jpg' width='100' alt=''>
</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
It was near the last of October when Bee returned
to Rothsay, where Everard greeted
her gladly as one who could understand, and
sympathize with him. It had come to him
at last like a shock that he loved Rosamond
Hastings as he had never loved Josephine, even in the
days of his wildest infatuation; and far different from
that first feverish, unhealthy passion of his boyhood was
this mightier love of his maturer manhood, which threatened
at last to master him so completely that he determined
at last to go away from Rothsay for a month, and,
amid the wilds of California and the rocky dells of Oregon
try to forget the girl whom to love was sin.</p>

<p class='c011'>To Beatrice he confessed everything, and rebelled
hotly against the bar which kept him from his love.</p>

<p class='c011'>He had thought of divorce, he said. He could easily
obtain one under the circumstances, but he was sure
Rossie would never believe in any divorce which was not
sanctioned by the Bible. He had assumed a case similar
to his own, which he pretended was pending in the
court, and warmly espousing the husband’s cause, had
asked Rosamond if she did not think it perfectly right
for the man to marry again.</p>

<p class='c011'>And she had answered decidedly:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I should despise him and the woman who married
him. I abominate these divorces so easily obtained. It
is wicked, and God will never forgive it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>After this there was nothing for Everard to do but
to take up his burden and carry it away with him to the
Far West, hoping to leave it there. But he did not, and
he came back to Rothsay to find Rossie sweeter, fairer
than ever, and so unfeignedly glad to see him that for
an hour he gave himself up to the happiness of the
moment, and defying both right and wrong, said things
which deepened the bloom on Rossie’s cheeks, and
brought to her eyes that new light which is so beautiful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>in its dawning, and which no one can mistake who is
skilled in its signs.</p>

<p class='c011'>He did not tell her he loved her; but he told her how
he had missed her, and how she alone had brought him
back sooner than he meant to come. And with a shyness
which sat so prettily on her, and a drooping of the eyelids,
she listened to him, and though she said but little
the mischief was done, and never again would her eyes
meet his as frankly and readily as before. Something in
the tone of his voice and the unwonted tenderness of his
manner kindled a fire in that young heart which many
waters could not extinguish, and to Rossie it came with
a thrill, half fearful, half ecstatic, that she loved Everard
Forrest, not as a sister loves a brother or friend loves
friend, but as a true, good woman loves the one who to
her is the only man in all the world. But could she have
followed him back to his room she would scarcely have
known the white-faced, haggard man whom the dawn
found with his head resting upon the table, where it had
lain most of the night, while he fought the demon trying
so hard to conquer him. He must not love Rosamond
Hastings; he must not let her love him; and to prevent
it he must tell her the whole truth, and this was what he
was trying to make up his mind to do.</p>

<p class='c011'>Possibly his resolution to confess the whole to Rosamond
was in a measure prompted by a sudden fear which
had come upon him lest the knowledge of his marriage
should reach her through some other channel. On his
return from Oregon, and before he went to the Forrest
House, he had found several letters which had come during
his absence, and which had not been forwarded.
One was from Josephine, who was still abroad and perfectly
happy, if her word was to be believed. She had
found Mrs. Arnold everything that was kind, and generous,
and considerate; had made many delightful acquaintances;
had learned to speak both German and
French, and had come across Dr. Matthewson, who was
at the same hotel with herself, the Victoria, in Dresden.</p>

<p class='c011'>This letter did not particularly affect Everard either
way. Dresden was very far off, and Josephine might remain
abroad another year, and into that time so much
happiness might be crowded that he would take the good
offered him, and not cross the river of difficulty until he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>fairly reached it. But on his return from the Forrest
House he found two more letters on his desk, one postmarked
at Dresden, the other at Holburton, and this he
opened first. It was from Agnes, and had been sometime
on the road, and told him that Mrs. Fleming had died
suddenly, after an illness of two days only, and Agnes
was left alone. There was still a mortgage on the house,
she said, and after that was paid, and the few debts they
were owing, there would be but little left for her, and
this little she must, of course, divide with Josephine.
She offered no complaint, nor asked for any help. She
said she could take care of herself, either as housekeeper,
cook, or nurse, and, on the whole, she seemed to be in a
very resigned and cheerful state of mind for a person
left so entirely alone. The other letter proved to be
from a Cincinnati acquaintance, with whom he had once
been at school, and who had recently married and gone
abroad, and was in Dresden, at the Victoria Hotel, where,
he said, there were many pleasant Americans, both from
Boston and New York, and Everard felt morally sure
that the pleasant people from Boston were Mrs. Arnold
and Josephine. And his friend, Phil Evarts, was just
the man to be attracted by Josey, even if he had a hundred
wives, and Josephine was sure to meet him more
than half-way, and find out first that he was from Cincinnati,
and then that he had been in Rothsay, and knew
Judge Forrest’s family, and then,—a cold sweat broke
out all over Everard’s face as he thought, <em>what then?</em>
while something whispered to him, “Then you will reap
the fruit of the deception practiced so long, and you deserve
it, too.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Everard knew he deserved it, but when one is reaping
the whirlwind, I do not think it is any comfort to know
that he has sowed the wind, or this harvest would never
have been. It certainly did not help Everard, but rather
added to the torments he endured as he thought of Josephine,
enraged and infuriated, swooping down upon him,
bristling all over with <em>injured innocence</em>, and making for
herself a strong party, as she was sure to do. But worse
than all would be the utter loss of Rossie, for she <em>would</em>
be lost to him forever, and possibly turn against him for
his duplicity, and that he could not bear.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll tell her to-morrow, so help me Heaven!” he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>said, as he laid his throbbing head upon his writing-table
and tried to think how he should commence, and
what she would say.</p>

<p class='c011'>He knew how she would look,—not scornfully and
angrily upon him,—but so sorry, so disappointed, and
that would hurt him worse than her contempt. How
fair and sweet she seemed to him, as he went over all
the past as connected with her, remembering, first, the
quaint, old-fashioned child he had teased so unmercifully,
and of whom he had made a very slave; then the girl of
fifteen, whose honest eyes had looked straight into his
without a shadow of shame or consciousness, as she
asked to be his wife; and, lastly, the Rossie of to-day,
the Rossie of long dresses and pure womanhood, who
was so dear to him that to have had her for his own for
one short, blessed year he felt that he would give the
rest of his life. But that could not be. She could
never be his, even were he free from the hated tie, as he
could be so easily. In her single-heartedness and truth
she would never recognize as valid any separation save
that which death might make, and this he dared not
wish for, lest to his other sins that of murder should be
added. He must tell her, and she would forgive him,
even while she banished him from her presence; but
after she knew it, whose opinion was worth more to him
than that of the whole world, he could bear whatever
else might come. But how could he tell her? Verbally?
and so see the surprise, and disappointment, and
pain which would succeed each other so rapidly in those
clear, innocent eyes which faithfully mirrored what she
felt. He knew there would be pain, for as he loved her
so he felt that she cared or could care for him, if only it
were right for her to do so, and selfish as he was, it hurt
him cruelly that she must suffer through his fault. But
it must be, and, at last, concluding that he never could
sit face to face with her while he confessed his secret,
he decided to write it out and send it to her, and then
wait a few days before going to see the effect. He
made this resolve just as the autumnal morning shone
full into his room, and he heard across the common the
bell from his boarding-house summoning him to breakfast.
But he could not eat, and after a vain effort at
swallowing a little coffee, he went back to his office,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>where, to his utter amazement and discomfiture, he
found Rosamond herself seated in his chair and smiling
brightly upon him as he came in.</p>

<p class='c011'>When he was with her the night before she had forgotten
to speak to him of a certain matter of business
which must be attended to that day, and immediately
after breakfast, which was always early at the Forrest
House, she had walked down to the office, and telling
the boy in attendance that he need not wait until Mr.
Forrest’s return, she sent him to his breakfast, and was
there alone when Everard came in.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Rossie, Rossie,” he gasped, as if the sight of her
unnerved him entirely, “why did you come here this
morning?”</p>

<p class='c011'>She did not tell him why she came, for she forgot her
errand entirely, in her alarm at his white, haggard face,
and the strangeness of his manner.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Mr. Everard!” she cried, for she called him
“Mr. Everard” still, as she had done when a child. “You
are sick. What is the matter? Sit down and let me
do something for you. Are you faint, or what is it?”
and, talking to him all the time, she made him sit down
in the chair she vacated, and brought him some water,
which he refused, and then, standing beside him, laid her
soft, cool hand upon his forehead, and asked if the pain
was there.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the touch of those hands Everard felt that he was
losing all his self-command. Except as he had held them
a moment in his own when he met her, or said good-by,
he had not felt those dainty fingers on his flesh since the
weeks of his sickness after his mother’s death, when
Rossie had been his nurse, and smoothed his aching brow
as she was doing now. Then her hands had a strange
power to soothe and quiet him, but now they made him
wild. He could not bear it, and, pushing her almost
rudely from him, he exclaimed: “Don’t, Rossie! I can’t
bear that you should touch me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There were tears in Rossie’s eyes at being so repulsed,
and for an instant her cheeks grew scarlet with resentment,
but before she could speak, overcome by an impulse
he could not resist, Everard gathered her swiftly in
his arms, and, kissing her passionately, said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Forgive me, Rossie. I did not mean to be rude,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>but why did you come here this morning to tempt me.
I was going to write and tell you what I ought to have
told you long ago, and the sight of you makes me such a
coward. Rossie, <em>my darling</em>; I will call you so once,
though it’s wrong, it’s wicked,—remember that. I am
not what I seem. I have deceived you all these years
since father died, and before, too,—long before. You
cannot guess what a wretch I am.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a long time since Rossie had thought of <em>Joe
Fleming</em>, with whom she believed Everard had broken
altogether; but she remembered him now, and, at once
attributing Everard’s trouble to that source, she said, in
her old, child-like way:</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s Joe Fleming again, Mr. Everard, and I hoped
you were done with him forever.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She was very pale, and her eyes had a startled look,
for the sudden caress and the words “my darling,” had
shaken her nerves, and roused in her a tumult of joy and
dread of she scarcely knew what; but she looked steadily
at Everard, who answered her bitterly:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, it is Joe Fleming,—always Joe Fleming,—and
I am going to tell you about it; but, Rossie, you must
promise not to hate me, or I never can tell you. Bee
knows and does not hate me. Do you promise, Rossie?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I promise, and I’ll help you if I can,” Rossie said,
without the slightest suspicion of the nature of the trouble.</p>

<p class='c011'>She never suspected anything. The shrewd, far-seeing
ones, who scent evil from afar, would say of her
that she was neither deep nor quick, and possibly she
was not. Wholly guileless herself, she never looked for
wrong until it was thrust in her face, and so was easily
deceived by what seemed to be good. She certainly
suspected no evil in Everard, and was anxious to hear
the story which he would have told her had it not been
for an interruption in the shape of Lawyer Russell, who
came suddenly into the office, bringing with him a
stranger who wished to consult with both the old lawyer
and the young. That, of course, broke up the conference,
and Rosamond was compelled to retire, thinking
more of the hot kiss which she could still feel upon her
forehead, and the words “my darling,” as spoken by
Everard, than of the story he had to tell.</p>

<p class='c011'>And all that day she flitted about the house, warbling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>snatches of song, and occasionally repeating to herself
“my darling,” as Everard had said it to her. If indeed
she were his darling, then nothing should separate them
from each other. She did not care for his past misdeeds,—or
for Joe Fleming. That was in the past. She believed
in Everard as he was now, and loved him, too.
She acknowledged that to herself, and her face burned
with blushes as she did so. And, looking back over the
past, she could not remember a time when she did not
love him, or rather worship him, as the one hero in the
world worthy of her worship. And now?—Rossie could
not give expression to what she felt now, or analyze the
great happiness dawning upon her, with the belief that
as she loved Everard Forrest, so was she loved in return.
She was very beautiful with this new light shining over
her face, and very beautiful without it. It was now two
years since she went unabashed to Everard and asked to
be his wife. Then she was fifteen and a-half, and a mere
child, so far as knowledge of the world was concerned,
and in some respects she was a child still, though she
was seventeen and had budded into a most lovely type
of womanhood. Her features were not as regular as
Bee’s, nor her complexion as soft and waxen; but it was
very fresh and bright and clear, and there was something
inexpressibly sweet and attractive in her face and the expression
of her eyes, while her rippling hair was wound in
masses about her well-shaped head, adding somewhat to
her apparent height and giving her a more womanly appearance
than when she wore it loosely in her neck. If
Rossie thought herself pretty, it was never apparent in
her manner. Indeed, she never seemed to think of herself
at all, though, as the day of which I am writing
drew to a close, she did spend more time than usual at
her toilet, and when it was finished felt tolerably satisfied
with the image reflected by her mirror, and was sure
that Everard would be suited, too. He would come that
night, of course. There was nothing else for him to do
after the events of the morning.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Everard did not come, and about noon of the
next day she received a few lines from him saying that
a business matter, of which Lawyer Russell and the
stranger with him were the harbingers, would take him
for a week or more, to southern Indiana. He had not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>time to say good-by in person, but he would write to
her from Dighton, and he hoped to find her well on his
return.</p>

<p class='c011'>That was all. Not an allusion to the confession he
was going to make,—not a sign that he had held her for
a moment in his arms and kissed her passionately, while
he called her his darling. He was going away on business
and would write to her. Nothing could be briefer
or more informal, though he called her his dear Rossie.
And Rossie, whose faith was not easily shaken, felt that
she was dear to him even though he disappointed her.
She would hold to that while he was absent, and though
her face was not quite as bright and joyous as the night
before, there was upon it an expression of happiness and
content which made watchful Mrs. Markham think
that, as she expressed it to herself, “something had happened.”</p>

It had rained all day in Dresden,—a steady,
persistent rain, which kept the guests of the
Hotel Victoria in-doors, and made them so
tired, and uncomfortable, and restless that
by night every shadow of reserve was swept
away, and they were ready to talk to any one who would
answer them in their own tongue. Conspicuous among
the guests assembled in the parlor was Miss Fleming,—“Miss
Josephine Fleming, Boston, U. S. A.,” she was
registered, and she passed for one of those Bostonians
who, whether deservedly or not, get the reputation
abroad of being very exclusive, and proud, and unapproachable.
Just now this character suited Josephine,
for she found that she was more talked about when she
was reserved and dignified than when she was forward
and flippant; so, though they had been at the Victoria
some weeks, she had made but few acquaintances, and
these among the English and the most aristocratic of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>Americans. And Josephine had never been so beautiful
as she was now. And she had the satisfaction of knowing
that she was always the most attractive woman in
every company, and the one most sought after. Of her
poverty she made no secret, and did not try to conceal
the fact that she was Mrs. Arnold’s companion. But
she had seen better days, of course, before papa died and
left his affairs so involved that they lost everything, and
mamma was compelled to take a few boarders to eke out
their income.</p>

<p class='c011'>This was her story, which took well when told by
herself, with sweet pathos in her voice and a drooping
of her long lashes over her lovely blue eyes. Every one
of her acquaintances of any account in America had been
stepping-stones in Europe, where she met people who
knew the Gerards, and John Hayden, and Miss Belknap,
who was her very heaviest card, the one she played most
frequently, and with the best success. The New Yorkers
all knew Beatrice, and were inclined to be very gracious
to her friend. Occasionally she had come across some
graduate from Amherst, whom she had met before, but
never till the rainy day with which this chapter opens
had she seen any one from the vicinity of Rothsay, or
who knew her husband personally. She was in the
habit of looking over the list of arrivals, and had seen
the names of “Mr. and Mrs. Philip Evarts, Cincinnati,
U. S. A.,” and had readily singled out the new-comers at
<i><span lang="fr">table d’hote</span></i>, divining at once that the lady was a bride;
but no words had passed between them until the evening
of the rainy day; then Josephine entered the parlor
faultlessly gotten up, and looking very sweet and lovely
in her dark-blue silk and velvet jacket, with her golden
hair caught up with an ivory comb. Nothing could be
prettier than she was, and Phil Evarts, who, as Everard
had said, was just the man to be attracted by such a
woman as Josephine, and whose wife was sick with a
headache in her room, managed to get near the beauty,
who took a seat apart from the others, and met his advance
with a swift glance of her dreamy eyes, which
made his heart beat faster than a man’s heart ought to
beat when his wife is up stairs with the headache.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was her business to speak first, and she said, very
modestly:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>“Excuse me, sir, but do you know if there has been
a mail since lunch?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t,” he replied, “but I will inquire. I am just
going to the office. What name shall I ask for?”</p>

<p class='c011'>She told him, and during the few minutes he was
gone he found out who Miss Fleming from Boston was,
and all about her that the English-speaking clerk knew.
But there was no letter for her, for which he was very
sorry. She was sorry, too; she did so want to hear
from home and sister. She did not say <em>mamma</em>, for she
knew her mother was dead, and had known it for a week,
and kept it to herself until she could decide whether to
wear black or not, and so shut herself out from any
amusements they might have in Paris, where they were
going next.</p>

<p class='c011'>Naturally the two began to talk of America, and
when Mr. Evarts spoke of Cincinnati as his home, she
said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have a friend who was once at school there.
Everard Forrest, of Rothsay, do you know him?”</p>

<p class='c011'>She had no idea that he did, and was astonished at
the vehemence with which he responded:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ned Forrest, of Rothsay! Of course I know him.
We were at school together. He’s the best fellow in the
world. And he is your friend, too?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” Josey answered, beginning at once to calculate
how much knowledge of Everard she would confess
to. “I knew him when he was in college at Amherst.
We lived in Holburton then, a little town over the line
in New York, and he was sometimes there, but I have
not seen him for a long time. I hope he is well.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He was the last time I saw him, which was three or
four months ago, perhaps more,” Mr. Evarts replied.
“He was in the city for a day, and I saw him just a moment.
He is working like a dog; sticks to his business
like a burr, which is so different from what I thought
he’d do, and he so rich, too.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is he?” Josephine asked; and Evarts replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, yes; his father must have been worth half a
million, at least, and Ned got the whole, I suppose.
There are no other heirs, unless something was given to
that girl who lived in the family. Rosamond Hastings
was the name, I think.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>“Is his father dead?” Josephine asked; and in her
voice there was a sharp ring which even stupid Phil
Evarts detected and wondered at.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dead? Yes,” he replied. “He has been dead I
should say nearly, if not quite, two years.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Josephine was for a moment speechless. Never in
her life had she received so great a shock. That Judge
Forrest should have been dead two years and she in
ignorance of it seemed impossible, and her first feeling
after she began to rally a little was one of incredulity,
and she asked:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Are you not mistaken?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, I’m not,” Mr. Evarts replied. “I saw Everard
in Covington a few weeks after his father’s death, and
talked to him of the sickness, which was apoplexy or
something of that sort. Anyway, it was sudden, and
Ned looked as if he hadn’t a friend in the world. I did
not suppose he cared so much for his father, who, I
always thought, was a cross old tyrant. I used to
visit at Forrest House occasionally years ago, when we
were boys, but have not been there since the judge’s
death. Ned does not often come to Cincinnati, and as I
have been gone most of the time for the last two years,
I have heard but little of him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How long, did you say, has his father been dead?”
Josephine asked; and Mr. Evarts replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“It must be two years in November, or thereabouts.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And this Rosamond Hastings who lives there, how
old is she, and is he going to marry her?” Josephine
asked next; while Evarts thought to himself:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Jealous, I do believe,” but he answered her:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Miss Hastings must be seventeen or eighteen, and
when I saw her, five or six years ago, was not so very
handsome.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, thank you,” Josey said, and as she just then saw
Mrs. Arnold coming into the salon, she bowed to her new
acquaintance, and walked away, with such a tumult in
her bosom as she had never before experienced.</p>

<p class='c011'>It would take her a little time to recover herself and
decide what to do. She must have leisure for reflection;
and she took it that night in her room, and sat up the entire
night thinking over the events of the last two years,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>as connected with Everard, and coming at last to the
conclusion that he was a <em>scoundrel</em>, whom it was her duty
as well as pleasure to punish by going to America at
once and claiming him as her husband.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the first days of her sudden bereavement, Agnes’
kind heart had gone out with a great yearning for her
young sister, to whom she had at once written of their
mutual loss, saying how lonely she was, and how she
hoped they would henceforth be more to each other than
they ever had been. And Josephine had been touched
and softened, and had written very kindly to Agnes, and
had cried several times in secret for the dead mother
she would never see again, but whose death she did not
then see fit to announce to Mrs. Arnold; but she would
do so now, and make it a pretext for going home at once.
Nothing should keep her from wreaking swift vengeance
on the man who had deliberately deceived her for two
years, and who, she had no doubt, was faithless to her in
feeling, if not in act. Of course there was a woman
concerned in the matter, and that woman was probably
Rossie Hastings, who, Mr. Evarts said, was still living at
the Forrest House, whither she meant to go in her own
person as Mrs. J. E. Forrest, and so rout the enemy,
and establish her own claims as a much-injured wife.
She did not mean to be violent or harsh, only grieved,
and hurt, and forgiving, and she had no doubt that in
time she should be the most popular woman in Rothsay,
not even excepting Beatrice, whose silence with regard
to the judge’s death she could not understand, inasmuch
as she could have had no reason for keeping it a secret.</p>

<p class='c011'>It may seem strange that as a friend of Everard’s
Phil Evarts had not heard of the judge’s will, but for
the last two or three years he had led a wandering kind
of life, and spent most of his time in Rio  Janeiro, and as
Everard had never spoken of his affairs on the few occasions
they had met since the judge’s death, he was in
total ignorance of the manner in which the judge had
disposed of his property. Had he known it, and told
Josephine, she might have acted differently, and hesitated
a little before she gave up a situation of perfect ease and
comparative luxury for the sake of a husband whom she
did not love, and who had nothing for her support except
his own earnings. But she did <em>not</em> know this, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>she was eager to confront him and <em>the jade</em>, as she stigmatized
Rosamond, and she packed some of her clothes
that night that she might start at once.</p>

<p class='c011'>Fortunately for her plans the next morning’s mail
from Paris brought her another letter from Agnes, who
thought she might be anxious to know what she had decided
to do, for the present, at least, until they could
consult together. But Josephine cared very little what
Agnes did. <em>She</em> was going to the Forrest House, and
she was glad that Dr. Matthewson, who had been with
her for a time at the hotel, had started for Italy only a
few days before. He might have opposed her plan, and
she knew from experience that it was hard to resist the
influence he had over her. Utterly reckless and unprincipled,
he seemed really to like this woman, whom he
thoroughly understood, and in whose nature he recognized
something which responded to his own. Two or
three times he had talked openly to her of a divorce, and
had hinted at a glorious life in Italy or wherever she
chose to go. But Josephine was too shrewd to consider
that for a moment. Dr. Matthewson lived only by his
wits, or to put it in plainer terms, by gambling and speculation
and intrigue. To-day he was rich, indulging in
every possible luxury and extravagance, and to-morrow
he was poor and unable to pay even his board; and much
as she liked him she had no fancy to share his style of
living. She preferred rather to be the hated wife of
Everard Forrest and the mistress of his house; so she
took Agnes’s letter to Mrs. Arnold, and with a great
show of feeling told her her mother was dead, and her
sister Aggie left all alone, and wanting her so badly that
she felt it her imperative duty to start at once for
America.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am sorry, of course, to leave you,” she said, “but
you have so many acquaintances now, and your health is
so much better, that you will do very nicely without me,
I am sure, and I have long felt that my position was
merely a sinecure. I am only an unnecessary expense.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Arnold knew that to some extent this was true.
Josephine was rather an expensive luxury, and she had
more than once seen in her signs of selfishness and
duplicity which shocked and displeased her. But the
girl had been uniformly kind and attentive to her, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>she was loth to part with her, and tried to persuade her
to wait till spring. But Josephine was determined, and
seeing this Mrs. Arnold ceased to oppose her, and generously
gave her two hundred dollars for her expenses
home; and Josephine took it, and smiled sweetly through
her tears, and kissed her friend gushingly, and then hurried
away to complete her preparations.</p>

<p class='c011'>The next day she left Dresden for Paris, where she
staid a week, while she selected a most becoming wardrobe
in black, and was delighted to see what a pretty,
appealing woman she was in her mourning, and how fair
and pure her skin showed through her long crape vail,
and how blue and pathetic her eyes looked, especially
when she managed to bring a tear into them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of course she was noticed, and commented upon,
and admired on shipboard, and when it was known why
she was going home alone, and why she was in such
deep mourning, she had everybody’s sympathies, and
was much sought after and petted.</p>

<p class='c011'>She was certainly a very fair picture to contemplate,
and the male portion of her fellow travelers indulged in
that pastime often, and anticipated her every movement,
and vied with each other in taking her chair to the most
sheltered and comfortable place, and adjusting her
wraps, and drawing her shawl a little closer around her
neck, and helping her below whenever she was at all
dizzy, as she frequently was; and when at last the <em>Ville
de Paris</em> came into port, and she stood on shore, frightened,
bewildered, and so much afraid of those <em>dreadful
custom-house officers</em>, though she had nothing dutiable
except a Madonna bought for <em>mamma</em> before she knew
she was dead, at least ten gentlemen stood by her, reassuring
her and promising to see her through, and succeeding
so well that not one of her four big trunks was
molested, and the captain himself helped her into the
carriage which was to take her to the Harlem depot.
With all the gallantry of a Frenchman he saw her comfortably
adjusted, and squeezing her hand a little, lifted
his hat politely, and wishing her <i><span lang="fr">bon voyage</span></i>, left her to
drive away toward the new life which was to be so different
from the old.</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
Everard had been gone nearly two weeks instead
of one, and Rosamond had not heard
from him except through Mr. Russell, who
told her that the business, which had reference
to sundry infringements on patents
and some missing deeds, was occupying him longer
than he had supposed it would, as it required much
research and a good deal of travel; “but he ought to be
home now, very soon,” he said to her one rainy morning
in November, when he came to see her on business
and found her sick in her room with a sore throat and
severe cold. Rossie had been very lonely with both
Everard and Beatrice away,—for the latter had been in
New York since September, and at last accounts was on
her way to Florida with Mollie Morton, who wished to
try the effect of a milder climate than Vermont, and as
Mr. Morton could not leave his church in Boston, which
had now become a permanency, Bee had consented to
accompany her, so Rossie was alone, and in a measure
defenseless, on the afternoon when Mrs. Markham announced
that the hack which ran to and from the depot
had turned into the avenue and was coming to the house,
and that it contained two ladies and at least three
trunks, if not four.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ladies and trunks coming here?” Rossie exclaimed,
starting up in bed and trying to listen to the
voices, which were soon heard speaking together at the
side door, where the hack had stopped.</p>

<p class='c011'>But she could distinguish nothing, and Mrs. Markham
went to ascertain who the strangers were. Half-way
down the stairs she met old Aunt Axie, who held in her
hand a black-bordered card on which was engraved the
name, “<span class='sc'>Mrs. J. E. Forrest</span>.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The young lady done gin me this to fotch to Miss
Hastings,” Axie said, as she handed the card to Mrs.
Markham, who twice repeated the name “<span class='sc'>Mrs. J. E.
Forrest</span>.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>“Who can she be? Had the judge any near relatives?”
she asked Axie, who replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not’s I knows on. I never hearn tell of any J. E.
Forrests, but Mars’r Everard.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where is the lady?” was Mrs. Markham’s next
question, and Axie replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“In the ’ception room, kind of shivrin’ and shakin’
as if she war cold. I reckon she’s come to stay a spell,
case the four big trunks is all in a pile in de side entry,
and she acts as ef she think she belong here, for she ask
sharp like, ‘Ain’t thar no fire you can take me to? I’m
chilled through.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Thar’s a fire in Miss Rossie’s room,’ I said, ‘but
she’s sick.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Miss who?’ she said, sharper still. ‘Is it Miss
Hastings you mean? Take her my card and say I’d
like to see her if possible,’ and that’s every blessed thing
I know ’bout ’em, only the old one looks queer and scart
like, and nothin’ in the house for dinner but a bit of
bacon,” and having told all she knew of the visitors,
Axie went on her way to report the same to Rosamond,
and confer with her about the dinner and the rooms the
guests were to occupy, while Mrs. Markham went down
to the reception-room to meet <span class='sc'>Mrs. J. E. Forrest</span>.</p>

<p class='c011'>Josephine had greatly surprised her sister by walking
in upon her unannounced one morning a few days previously,
and had still further astonished her by saying
that Judge Forrest was dead, and that she had come
home in order to go at once to Rothsay and her husband.
She laid great stress on that word, and gave Agnes to
understand that he had written to her of his father’s
death, and that it was at his request she had crossed the
sea to join him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But won’t he come here for you? Seems to me
that would have a better look,” Agnes said, and her sister
replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“He is quite too busy to waste his time that way,
for we can go alone; he knows I am accustomed to traveling.
We will start at once, I am so anxious to be there.
We can shut up the house for the present, until matters
are adjusted, when you or I can come back and see to
the things.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Could Agnes have had her choice she would have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>preferred remaining where she was, for she dreaded
change of any kind. But go she must, for her presence
would add weight and respectability to Josephine, who
was very kind to her, and made the leaving Holburton as
easy as possible. To a few of her old friends Josephine
told the secret of her marriage, showing her certificate,
and saying, now her father-in-law was dead there was
nothing in the way of publishing the marriage to the
world, and that she was going to her husband.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of course all Holburton was excited, some believing
the story, others discrediting it, but all remembering the
play and the mock marriage which had seemed so solemn
and real. But Josephine was not popular, and few if
any regrets were sent after her when she started for
the Forrest House, which she reached on the chill November
day, when everything was looking its very worst.</p>

<p class='c011'>Even the grounds had a bare, gray look, but they
were very spacious and large, and Josephine felt a throb
of pride as she rode up the avenue, looking eagerly out
at the great, square, old-fashioned building, which,
though massive, and stately, and pretentious, was not
quite what she had expected to find. There was about
it a shut-up, deserted air, which made her ask the hackman
if there was any one at home, or why the blinds
were all closed except in the wing.</p>

<p class='c011'>The hackman was a negro who had once been in
Judge Forrest’s employ, and he replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Miss Rossie’s dar whar you see de shutters open,
but de rest she keep closed sense old marster died.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was something like a flash of indignation in
Josephine’s eyes as she thought how soon she would
change the administration of the household, and make
Miss Rossie know her place.</p>

<p class='c011'>They had reached the side entrance by this time, and
Josephine waited in her seat an instant in the hope that
her truant lord might come himself to see who his visitors
were. In that case she meant to be forgiving, and put
her arms around his neck, and kiss him, and whisper in
his ear: “I know everything, but I come in peace, not
in war. Let us be friends, and do you leave the explanation
to me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She had decided upon this plan since leaving Holburton,
for the nearer she drew to Rothsay the more she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>began to dread and fear the man who she knew had outlived
all love and respect for her. But only Aunt Axie’s
broad, black face looked out into the rain, and beamed a
smile on Luke, the driver, who was a distant relative.</p>

<p class='c011'>Springing lightly from the carriage Josey ran up the
steps into the hall, where she stood while Agnes joined
her, and Luke deposited the heavy trunks and claimed
his customary fee, and a little more on the plea of “so
many big boxes to tote.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But Josephine refused him sharply, and then followed
Aunt Axie into the cold reception-room, where no fire
had been made that day, for Rossie had never abandoned
her determination to use as little as possible of the Forrest
money, and nothing superfluous was expended either
in fuel, or eatables, or dress. So far as her own income,—a
matter of one hundred and forty dollars or thereabouts,—was
concerned, she was very generous and free;
but when it came to Everard’s money, as she called it,
her economies were almost painful at times, and wrung
many a remonstrance from old Axie, the cook.</p>

<p class='c011'>With a shiver and a quick, curious glance around the
cheerless room, Josephine turned to Aunt Axie and
said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is Mr. Forrest at home,—Mr. Everard Forrest?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, miss. He done went away quite a spell ago,
but Miss Rossie’s ’spectin’ him every day. He don’t live
here, though, when he’s home; he stay mostly in de
town.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Josephine did not understand her, and continued:</p>

<p class='c011'>“He will come here, I suppose, as soon as he returns?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, miss, he’s sure to do dat,” and Axie nodded
knowingly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of course, she had no suspicion who this lady was,
walking about the room and examining the furniture with
a critical and not favorable eye, and asking, at last, if
there was no fire where she could warm herself after her
cold ride?</p>

<p class='c011'>On being told there was a fire in Miss Rossie’s room,
she took from her purse one of the cards she had had engraved
in Paris, and bidding Axie take it to Miss Hastings,
sat down to await the result. To Agnes she said,
in something of her old, dictatorial tone:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pray, don’t look so nervous and frightened, as if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>we were a pair of burglars. It is my husband’s house,
and I have a right here.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I know,” faltered Agnes; “but it looks as if
they did not expect you,—as if he did not know you
were coming, or he would have been home, and it’s all
so dreary; I wish I was back in Holburton,” and poor,
homesick Agnes began to cry softly.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Josephine bade her keep quiet.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You let me do the talking,” she said. “You need
not speak, or if you have to you must assent to what you
hear me say, even if it is not all quite true.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Josephine had expected Rosamond herself, and had
taken a very pretty attitude, and even laid off her hat so
as to show her golden hair, which, in the dampness, was
one mass of waves and curls and little rings about her
forehead. She meant to astonish and dazzle the girl
whom she suspected as her rival, and who she imagined
to be plain and unprepossessing, and when she heard a
step outside she drew herself up a little, but had no intention
of rising. She should assert her superiority at
once, and sit while she received Miss Hastings rather
than be received by her. How then was she disappointed
and chagrined when, instead of Rossie, there appeared
on the threshold a middle-aged woman, who showed that
she was every whit a lady, and whose manner, as she
bowed to the blonde beauty, brought her to her feet immediately.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mrs. Forrest?” Mrs. Markham said, interrogatively,
consulting the card she held, and then glancing at Josephine,
who answered her:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, Mrs. J. E. Forrest. My husband, it seems, is
not here to receive me and explain matters, for which I
am very sorry.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Even then Mrs. Markham had no suspicion of the
truth. The husband referred to was, of course, some
distant relative, who was to have been there in advance
of his wife, and she replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, there has been no gentleman here, but that
does not matter, except as it may be awkward for you.
Miss Hastings will make you very welcome, though she
is sick to-day and in bed. Your husband is a relative of
Mr. Everard Forrest, I presume.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A relative! My husband <em>is</em> Mr. Everard Forrest,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>Josephine said. “We were married four years ago last
summer, and at his request, I have kept it a secret ever
since. But my sister,” and she nodded toward Agnes,
“saw me married, and I have my marriage certificate in
my bag. Agnes, give me my satchel, please,” and she
turned again to Agnes, who knew now that they were
there unexpected and unknown, and her face was very
white as she brought the satchel for Josephine to open.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Markham was confounded and incredulous, and
she showed it in her face as she dropped into a chair and
stared wonderingly at her visitor, who, from a little box
fastened with lock and key, abstracted a paper which
she handed her to read.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know just how I must seem to you,” Josephine
said. “You think me an adventuress, an impostor, but
I am neither. I am Everard Forrest’s lawful wife, as
this certificate will show you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Markham did not reply, for she was reading
that, at Holburton, New York, on the evening of the
17th of July, 18—, Mr. James E. Forrest, of Rothsay,
Ohio, was united in matrimony to Miss Josephine
Fleming, by the Rev. Mr. Matthewson. There could be
no mistake apparently, unless this paper was a forgery
and the woman a lunatic, and still Mrs. Markham could
not believe it. She had a great respect and liking for
Everard, and held him as a model young man, who would
never stoop to deception like this, and then,—there was
Rossie! and the kind-hearted woman felt a pang of pity
and a throb of indignation as she thought how Rossie had
been wronged and duped if this thing were true, and this
woman confronting her so calmly and unflinchingly
were really Everard’s wife.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I cannot believe it. I will not believe it,” she
thought; and as composedly as it was possible for her to
do, she said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“This is a strange story you tell me, and if it is true
it bears very heavily against Mr. Forrest, who has never
been suspected of being a married man.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I knew it; I guessed as much. Oh, Josey, why did
you come before he sent for you? Let’s go away. You
are not wanted here!” Agnes exclaimed, as she came
swiftly to her sister’s side and laid her hand on her
arm.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>But Josephine shook it off fiercely, and in a tone she
knew so well how to assume, said commandingly, as if
speaking to a child:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mind your business, Agnes, and let me attend to
my own affairs. I have kept quiet long enough; four
years of neglect would try the patience of any woman,
and if he does not choose to recognize me as his wife I
shall compel him to do so. You saw me married; you
know I am telling the truth. Speak, Agnes, did you not
see me married to Everard Forrest?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I did, may God forgive me,” was Agnes’ meek
reply, but still Mrs. Markham could not believe her, and
was silent while Josephine went on:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do not wish for any scene, or talk, or excitement.
I <em>am</em> Everard Forrest’s wife, and I wish only to be known
as such. I hoped to find him here, for then it would be
<em>his</em> duty to explain, not mine. Do I understand he is
not in town, or not at home? Possibly he is in his office,
in which case I will seek him there.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He is not in town,” Mrs. Markham said; “he went
to Indiana on business more than a week ago, and has
not yet returned. He does not live here when he is at
home; he boards in the village. Miss Hastings lives
here; this is her house; perhaps you do not know that
Judge Forrest died, and——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I do,” Josephine interrupted her, beginning to
get irritated and lose her self-command as she saw that
she was not believed, “I do know Judge Forrest is dead,
and has been for two years or more; but I learned it accidentally,
and as <em>he</em> was the only obstacle in the way of
my recognition as Everard’s wife, I came at once, as I
had a right, to my husband’s house.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But this is <em>not</em> his house,” Mrs. Markham replied.
“It belongs to Miss Hastings. Everything belongs to
her. Judge Forrest left it to her by will. Didn’t you
know that?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, I did not,” Josephine answered, and for a moment
she turned deathly white as she saw the ground
slipping from under her feet. “Left everything to Miss
Hastings and disinherited his son! Why was that?” she
asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t know why he did it,” Mrs. Markham replied,
“I know only that he did, and it is strange Mr. Forrest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>did not write that to you, as you must, of course, have
been in correspondence with him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She spoke sarcastically, and Josephine knew she was
looked upon with distrust, notwithstanding the certificate,
which she had thought would silence all doubt; and
that, added to what she had heard of the disposition of
the Forrest property, provoked her to wrath, and her
eyes, usually so dreamy and blue, emitted sparks of anger,
and seemed to turn a kind of whitish gray as she
burst out:</p>

<p class='c011'>“My correspondence with my husband has not been
very frequent or full. I told you I did not hear from
him of his father’s death; he never hinted at such a
thing, and how was I to know that he was disinherited?
If I had it might have made a difference, and I should
have thought twice before crossing the sea and giving
up a life I enjoyed, for the sake of coming here to find
myself suspected as an impostor, which, under the circumstances,
is natural perhaps, and to find also that my
husband is a pauper, and the home I had confidently
expected would one day be mine given to a stranger.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Josephine was almost crying when she finished this
imprudent speech, in which she betrayed that all she
really cared for was the home and the money which she
had expected to find. Mrs. Markham saw this, and it
did not tend to increase her respect for the lady, though
she did pity her, if, as she affirmed, she were really
Everard’s wife, for with her knowledge of human nature,
she guessed that if there really had been a marriage
it was a hasty thing, repented of almost as soon as done,
by Everard at least. But she did not know what to say
until Josephine, who had recovered herself, continued:
“I should like to see Miss Hastings, if possible, and
apologize for my intrusion into her house, and then I
will go to the hotel and await my husband’s return;”
then she answered quickly; “Miss Hastings, I am sure,
will say you are welcome to remain here as long as you
like, but I do not think she will see you to-day, and if
you will excuse me, I will go to her now, as she must be
anxious to know who her visitors are.”</p>

<p class='c011'>With this Mrs. Markham arose, and bowing to
Josephine left the room, and went directly to Rosamond.</p>

She did not bear it well at all, although she was
in some degree prepared for it by the card
which Axie brought her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mrs. J. E. Forrest,—Mrs. J. E. Forrest,”
she repeated as she examined the card,
while something undefinable, like the shadow of coming
evil, began to stir her heart. “Who can she be, and
where did she come from? You say she has a maid?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, or suffin’ like dat,—a quar-lookin’ woman, who
has a lame hand. I noticed the way she slung the lady’s
satchel over it, and it hung slimpsey like.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How does the lady look, and what did she say?
Tell me everything,” Rosamond said; and Axie, who began
to have a suspicion that the lady was not altogether
welcome, replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“She done squabble fust thing wid the driver, who
ax more for fetchin’ and liftin’ her four big trunks, an’
she hold up her gown and walk as ef the groun’ wasn’t
good enough for her, an’ she looked round de room kind
o’ sniffin’ like, wid her nose turned up a bit as she axed
me was thar no fire. But my, she be very hansom’ and
no mistake. All in black, with such nice skin and pretty
eyes, wid dem great long lashes, like Miss Beatrice.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Rossie could deny herself everything, but she was
never indifferent to the comfort of others, and though
she could not help feeling that this woman, who called
herself Mrs. J. E. Forrest, would in some way work her
harm, she could understand just how cold and cheerless
the house must seem to her on that rainy day; and she
ordered Axie to build fires in both the rooms below, as
well as in the chamber where Everard occasionally spent
a night, and which was the only guest-room she kept
in order. There was also a consultation on the important
subject of dinner, and then Rossie was left alone
for a few moments to puzzle her brain as to who this
woman could be, and wonder why her heart should feel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>so like lead, and her pulse beat so rapidly. She did not
have long to wait for a solution of the mystery before
Mrs. Markham came in, showing at once that she was
agitated and distressed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is it, Mrs. Markham? Is she any relation to
Mr. Everard?” Rossie asked eagerly.</p>

<p class='c011'>It would be wrong to keep her in suspense a moment
longer than was necessary, and going up to her, Mrs.
Markham replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“She says she is Everard’s wife; and I have seen the
certificate. They were married more than four years
ago, before his mother died, and she,—oh, Rossie, my
child, my child, don’t give way like that; it may—it
must be false,” she added, in alarm, as she saw the
death-like pallor which spread over Rossie’s face, and
the look of bitter pain and horror which leaped into her
eyes, while the quivering lips whispered:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Everard’s wife? No, no, no!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t, Rossie,—don’t!” Mrs. Markham said again,
as she passed her arm around the girl, whose head drooped
upon her shoulder, in a hopeless kind of way, and
who said: “You saw the certificate? What was the
name? Was it——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Fleming,—Josephine Fleming, of Holburton,” Mrs.
Markham replied, and with a shiver Rossie drew herself
away from Mrs. Markham’s arms, and turning her face
to the wall, said: “Yes, I know. I understand it all.
She is his wife. She is Joe Fleming.”</p>

<p class='c011'>After that she neither spoke nor moved, and when
Mrs. Markham, alarmed at her silence, bent down to
look at her, she found that she had fainted. The
shock had proved too great for Rossie, whose mind, at
the mention of Josephine Fleming, had with lightning
rapidity gathered all the tangled threads of the past,
and comprehended what had been so mysterious at
times in Everard’s behavior. He <em>was married</em>,—hastily,
no doubt, but still married; and Joe Fleming was his
wife, and he had never told her, but suffered her to
believe that he loved her, just as she knew now that
she loved him. It was a bitter humiliation, and for
an instant there gathered round her so thick a horror
and blackness that she fancied herself dying; but it
was only a faint, and she lay so white and rigid that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>Mrs. Markham summoned Aunt Axie from the dining-room,
where she was making preparations for kindling
a fire in the grate.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Be quiet,” Mrs. Markham said to her as she came
up the stairs. “Miss Rossie has fainted, but don’t let
those people know it; and bring me some hot water
for her feet, quick.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Axie obeyed, wondering to herself why her young
mistress should faint, when she never knew her to do
such a thing before, and with her ready wit connecting
it in some way with the strangers whom Mrs.
Markham had designated as “those people,” and whom
the old negress directly set down as “no ’count folks.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was some time before Rossie came back to consciousness,
and when she did her first words were:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where is she? Where is Everard’s wife? Don’t
let her come in here; I could not bear it now.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Everard’s wife! Mars’r Everard’s wife!” Axie
repeated, tossing her turbaned head and rolling up
her eyes in astonishment. “In de deah Lord’s name,
what do de chile mean? Dat ain’t Mars’r Everard’s
wife?” and she turned to Mrs. Markham, who, now
that Rossie had betrayed what she would have kept
until Everard came to confirm or deny the tale, replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“She says she is; but we must wait until Mr. Forrest
comes before we admit it. So don’t go talking outside.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Catch me talkin’,” was Axie’s rejoinder. “It’s a
lie. Mars’r Everard hain’t got no wife. I should of
knowed it if he had. Don’t you b’lieve it, honey,” and
she laid her hard black hand caressingly on the head of
the girl whom she had long since singled out as Everard’s
future wife, watching shrewdly the growing intimacy
between the two young people, and knowing better than
they did just when the so-called brother merged into the
lover, and she would not for a moment believe in another
wife, and a secret one at that. “No, honey,” she continued,
“don’t you b’lieve it. Mars’r Everard hain’t got
no wife, and never will have, but you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, Aunt Axie,” Rossie said, “this woman tells
the truth. She <em>is</em> his wife, and Everard ought to come
home. We must telegraph at once. He is in Dighton
still.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Markham accordingly wrote on a slip of paper:</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>“To <span class='sc'>J. E. Forrest</span>, Dighton:—Come immediately.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>S. Markham.</span>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>And Axie’s granddaughter Lois, who lived in the
house, was commissioned to take it to the office. A fire
had been kindled by this time in the chamber Josephine
was to occupy, and she was there with Agnes, and had
rung for warm water, which Lois took up to her before
going on her errand. As the child was leaving the room
Josephine said to her: “Is there a paper published in
town?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes’m, the Rothsay <cite>Star</cite>” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c011'>“When does it come out?” was the next question,
and Lois said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Saturday,—to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very well. I wish you to take a notice to the office
of the <cite>Star</cite> for me to-night, and I will give you a
quarter.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Twenty-five cents seemed a fortune to the little negro
girl, who was greatly impressed with the beauty of the
lady, and who replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, miss, I’ll do ’em. I’s gwine to the village
directly with a telegraph to Mars’r Everard, and I’ll take
yourn same time.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So, when, a little later, she started for the telegraph
office, she bore with her to the Rothsay Star the following:</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Married.</span>—In Holburton, N. Y., July 17, 18—, by
the Rev. John Matthewson, <span class='sc'>James Everard Forrest</span>, of
Rothsay, Ohio, and Miss <span class='sc'>Josephine Fleming</span>, of Holburton.”</p>

</div>

<div class='c010'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/di_243.jpg' width='100' alt=''>
</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
When Aunt Axie was called so suddenly by
Mrs. Markham, she was kindling the fire in
the dining-room, which adjoined the room
where Josephine sat shivering with cold, and
feeling like anything but a happy wife just
come to her husband’s ancestral halls. Tired with her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>rapid journey, and disappointed and shocked by what
she had heard from Mrs. Markham of the judge’s will,
Josey was nearer giving way to a hearty cry than she
had been before in a long time. It had been far better
to have staid where she was, and enjoyed the life she
liked, than to have come here and subject herself to suspicion
and slights from the people who did not know her.
And then she was so cold, and chilly, and uncomfortable
generally.</p>

<p class='c011'>But when the fire was made she felt better, and
drawing an easy chair close to it assumed her usual indolent
and lounging attitude. Twice Axie, who seemed
to be excited, passed the door, once when she was taking
the hot water to Rossie’s room, and again, later, after
she had received an impression of the strangers against
whom she had mentally declared war. This time Josephine
called her. She had heard an unusual stir above,
and from Mrs. Markham’s protracted absence, and Axie’s
evident haste, suspected that the bombshell she had
thrown had taken effect, especially if, as she believed,
Rosamond was particularly interested in Everard.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Woman,” she said, as the black face glanced in,
“what is your name?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Axie, ma’am,” was the crisp reply, and Josephine
continued: “Oh, yes, I have heard my husband speak of
you. I am very sorry he is not here to set matters
right. What is the matter up stairs? Is any one suddenly
ill?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Axie was bristling with resentment toward this
woman, who called Everard her husband so coolly, and
in whom she would not believe till she had her master’s
word of confirmation. Still, she must not be insolent,
that was against her creed; but she answered with great
dignity, “I tole you Miss Hastin’s was sick when you
fust come. Her throat be very sore, an’ her head mighty
bad; so, you’ll scuse me, now,” and with a kind of suppressed
snort Axie departed, jingling her keys and tossing
her blue-turbaned head high in the air.</p>

<p class='c011'>Josephine knew perfectly well how she was regarded
in the house, and, irritated and chagrined, decided at
once upon her policy. She should be very amiable and
sweet, of course, but <em>firm</em> in asserting her rights. She
was Everard’s wife, and she could prove it, and it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>natural that she should come to what she supposed was
his home and hers. It was not her fault that she had
made the mistake. The wrong was on his side, and she
should stay there until he came, unless they turned her
from the door, which she hardly thought they would do.</p>

<p class='c011'>Just then Mrs. Markham appeared, apologizing for
her long absence, and saying that though Miss Hastings
was, of course, surprised at what she had heard, she did
not discredit it, and would telegraph at once for Mr.
Forrest.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Meantime,” she continued, “she wishes you to remain
here till he comes, and has given orders to have
you made comfortable. I believe there is a fire in your
room, if you wish to go to it before dinner. Miss Hastings
is too ill to see you herself.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thanks; she is very kind. I would like to go to
my room, and to have one of my trunks sent up. Agnes
will show you which one,—the small leather box,” Josephine
said, with a dignified bow, as she rose from her
chair.</p>

<p class='c011'>Calling Aunt Axie, Mrs. Markham bade her conduct
the lady to her room, where a bright wood fire was blazing,
and which looked very cheerful and pleasant; for,
as it was Everard’s room, where he always slept when he
spent a night at the Forrest House, Rosamond had taken
great pains to keep it nice, and had transferred to it several
articles of furniture from the other rooms. Here
Josey’s spirits began to rise, and it was in quite a comfortable
state of mind that she dressed herself for dinner,
in a gown of soft cashmere, with just a little white
at her throat and wrists. As it was only her mother for
whom she mourned, she had decided that she might wear
a jet necklace, which heightened the effect of her dress,
if indeed it needed anything more to improve it than
the beautiful face and wealth of golden hair. Even
Mrs. Markham drew an involuntary breath as this vision
of loveliness and grace came into the room, apologizing
for being tardy, and inquiring so sweetly for Miss Hastings,
who, she hoped, was no worse.</p>

<p class='c011'>Her policy was to be a sweet as well as a firm one,
and before dinner was over even Mrs. Markham began
to waver a little in her first opinion, and wonder why
Everard should have kept secret his marriage with this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>brilliant, fascinating woman, who seemed so much of a
lady, and who evidently was as well born as himself, at
least on the maternal side, for Josey took care to say
that her mother knew Mrs. Forrest when she was a girl,
and was present at her wedding in Boston, but that, owing
to adverse circumstances, they saw nothing of each
other after the marriage.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Papa was unfortunate and died, and we moved into
the country, where, for a time, mamma had a hard struggle
to keep up, and at last took a few boarders in order
to live,” she said; and her blue eyes were very tender
and pathetic as she told what in one sense was the truth,
though a truth widely different from the impression she
meant to convey.</p>

<p class='c011'>Once Agnes, whose face was very white, gave her
such a look of sorrowful entreaty that Mrs. Markham
observed and wondered at it, just as she wondered at
the great difference between the sisters, and could only
account for it on the supposition that Agnes’ mother
was a very different woman from the second Mrs.
Fleming, who had been a friend of Mrs. Forrest, and a
guest at her wedding! Miss Belknap was, of course,
brought into the conversation, and Josephine was sorry
to hear that she was not at home.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I depended upon her to vouch for my respectability.
She knows me so well,” she said, explaining that Beatrice
had been for some time an inmate of her mother’s
house in Holburton, and that she had liked her so much,
and then, more bewildered than ever, Mrs. Markham
went over half-way to the enemy, and longed for the
mystery to be explained.</p>

<p class='c011'>The next day, which was Saturday, it rained with a
steady pour, and Josephine kept her room, after having
expressed a wish to see Miss Hastings, if possible; but
when this request was made known to Rossie by Mrs.
Markham, she exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, no,—not her; not Joe Fleming! I could not
bear it till Mr. Everard comes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She was thinking of her hair and the letter, and the
persistence with which Joe Fleming had demanded
money from Everard, and it made no difference with her
that Mrs. Markham represented the woman as pretty,
and lady-like, and sweet. She could <em>not</em> see her, and a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>message to the effect that she was too weak and sick
to talk with strangers was taken to Josephine, who
hoped Miss Hastings was not going to be seriously
ill, and offered the services of her sister, who had the
faculty of quieting the most nervous persons and putting
them to sleep. But Rossie declined Agnes too, and
lay with her face to the wall, scarcely moving, and
never speaking unless she was spoken to. And Josephine
lounged in her own room, and had her lunch brought up
by Axie, to whom she tried to be gracious. But Axie
was not easily won. She did not believe in Mrs. J. E.
Forrest, and looked upon her presence there as an affront
to herself and an insult to Rossie, and when about two
o’clock the Rothsay <cite>Star</cite> was brought into the house by
her husband, John, who was in a state of great excitement
over the marriage notice, which had been pointed
out to him, she wrung from Lois the fact that she had
carried a note to the editor, and had been paid a quarter
for it by the lady up stairs. She put the paper away
where it could not be found if Rossie chanced to ask for it.</p>

<p class='c011'>But she could not keep it from the world as represented
by Rothsay, for it was already the theme of
every tongue. The editor had read the note which
Josephine sent him before Lois left the office, and had
questioned her as to who sent her with it. Lois had
answered him:</p>

<p class='c011'>“De young lady what comed from de train wid four
big trunks and bandbox.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And where is she now?” he asked, and Lois replied:
“Up sta’rs in Mas’r Everard’s room.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This last was proof conclusive of the validity of the
marriage, which the editor naturally concluded was a
hasty affair of Everard’s college days, when he had the
reputation of being rather wild and fast, and so he published
the notice and in another column called attention
to it, as the last great excitement.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of course there was much wondering, and surmising,
and guessing, and in spite of the rain the ladies who
lived near each other got together and talked it up, and
believed or discredited it according to their several
natures. Mrs. Dr. Rider, a chubby, good-natured, inquisitive
woman, declared her intention of knowing the
facts before she slept. Her husband attended Rosamond,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>and she had a sirup which was just the medicine
for a sore throat and influenza, such as Rossie was
suffering from, and she would take it to her, and perhaps
learn the truth of the story of Everard’s marriage.</p>

<p class='c011'>Accordingly, about four o’clock that afternoon, Mrs.
Dr. Rider’s little covered phaeton turned into the Forrest
avenue, and was seen from the window by Josephine,
who, tired and <em>ennuyeed</em>, was looking out into the
rain.</p>

<p class='c011'>That the phaeton held a lady she saw, and as the
lady could only be coming there she resolved at once to
put herself in the way of some possible communication
with the outer world. Glancing at herself in the mirror
she saw that she was looking well, although a little paler
than her wont, but this would make her more interesting
in the character she meant to assume, that of an angelic
martyr. As the day was chilly, a soft white wrap of
some kind would not be out of place, and would add to
the effect.</p>

<p class='c011'>So she snatched up a fleecy shawl of Berlin wool,
and throwing it around her shoulders, took with her a
book, and hurrying down to the reception-room, had
just time to seat herself gracefully and becomingly, when
the door opened and Mrs. Dr. Rider came in.</p>

<p class='c011'>Aunt Axie, who was a little deaf, was in the kitchen
busy with her dinner, while Lois was in the barn, hunting
for eggs, and so no one heard the bell, which Mrs.
Rider pulled twice, and then, presuming upon her long
acquaintance with the house, opened the door and walked
into the reception-room, where she stopped for an instant,
startled by the picture of the pretty blonde in
black, with the white shawl, and the golden hair rippling
back from the beautiful face.</p>

<p class='c011'>Here was a stroke of what Mrs. Rider esteemed luck.
She had stumbled at once upon the very person she had
come to inquire about, and as she was not one to lose any
time, she shook the rain-drops from her waterproof, and
drawing near to the fire, turned to the lady in the easy-chair,
and said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I beg your pardon for my very unceremonious entrance.
I rang twice, and then ventured to come in, it
was raining so hard.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Josephine admitted that it was raining hard, and remarked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>that she expected to find it warmer in Southern
Ohio than in Eastern New York, but she believed it was
colder, and with a shiver she drew her shawl around
her shoulders, shook back her hair, and lifted her blue
eyes to Mrs. Rider, who responded:</p>

<p class='c011'>“You came from the East, then?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, madam, from Holburton. That is, I am from
there just now, but it’s only two weeks since I returned
from Europe, where I have been for a long time.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Here there was a solution in part of the mystery.
This wife had been in Europe, and that was why the
secret had been kept so long, and little Mrs. Dr. Rider
flushed with eager excitement and pleasurable curiosity
as she said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“From Europe! You must be tired with your long
journey. Have you ever been in Rothsay before?
From your having come from the East I suppose you
must be a relative of Mrs. Forrest, who was born in
Boston?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Josephine knew she did not suppose any such thing,
and that in all probability she had seen the notice in the
<cite>Star</cite>, and had come to spy out the land, but it was not
her policy to parade her story unsolicited; so she merely
replied that she was not a relative of Mrs. Forrest’s,
though her mamma and that lady had been friends in
their girlhood. To have been a friend of the late Mrs.
Forrest stamped a person as somebody, and Mrs. Rider
began at once to espouse the cause of this woman, to
whom she said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I hope you will excuse me if I seem forward in what
I am about to say. I am Mrs. Rider, wife of the family
physician, and a friend of Everard, and when I saw that
notice of his marriage in the <cite>Star</cite> I could hardly credit
it, though I know such things have been before; but four
years is such a long time to keep an affair of that kind a
secret. May I ask if it is true, and if you are the wife?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is true, and I am his wife, or I should not be
here,” Josey said, very quietly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, certainly not, of course,” Mrs. Rider replied,
hardly knowing what she was saying, and wishing that
the fair blonde whose eyes were looking so steadily into
the fire would say something more, but she didn’t.</p>

<p class='c011'>She was waiting for her visitor to question her, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>she presently did, for she could never leave the matter in
this way, so she said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“You will pardon me, Mrs. Forrest, but knowing a
little makes me want to know more. It seems so strange
that Everard should have been a married man for more
than four years and we never suspect it. It must have
been a private marriage.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ye-es, in one sense,” Josephine said, with the air of
one who is having something wrung from him unwillingly.
“A great many people saw us married, for it
was in a drama,—a play,—but none of them knew it was
meant to be real and binding, except Everard and myself
and the clergyman, who was a genuine clergyman.
We knew and intended it, of course, or it would not
have been valid. We were engaged, and did it on the
impulse of the moment, thinking no harm. Nor was
there, except that we were both so young, and Everard
not through college. We told mother and sister, but no
one else, and as the villagers did not know of our intention
to be married, or that Dr. Matthewson was a clergyman,
they never suspected the truth, and the secret
was to be kept until Everard was graduated, and after
that——”</p>

<p class='c011'>She spoke very slowly now, and drew long breaths, as
if every word she uttered were a stab to her heart.</p>

<p class='c011'>“After that I hoped to get out of my false position,
but there was some fear of Judge Forrest, which kept
Everard silent, waiting for an opportunity to tell him,
for I was not rich, you know, and he might be angry; so
I waited patiently, and his father died, and I went to
Europe, and thus the years have gone.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The blue eyes, in which the tears were shining, more
from steadily gazing into the fire than from emotion of
any kind, were lifted to Mrs. Rider, who was greatly affected,
and then said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I see; but when the judge died there was
nothing in the way of acknowledging the marriage. I
am surprised and disappointed in Everard that he should
treat you thus.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Rider’s sympathy was all with the injured wife,
who seemed so patient and uncomplaining, and who replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“He had good reasons, no doubt. His father disinherited
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>him, I believe, and that may have had its effect;
but I do not wish it talked about until Everard comes.
It is very awkward for me that he is absent. I expected
to meet him. I must come, of course; there was no other
way, for mamma recently died, and the old home was
broken up. I must come to my husband.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She kept asserting it as if in apology for her being
there, and her voice trembled, and her whole air was one
of such injured innocence that Mrs. Rider resolved within
herself to stand by her in the face of all Rothsay, if
necessary. Mrs. Rider was a very motherly little woman,
and her heart went out at once to this girl, whose blue
eyes and black dress appealed so strongly to her sympathies.
She liked Everard, too, and did not mean to be
disloyal to him, if she could help it, but she should
stand by the wife; and she was so anxious to get away
and talk up the wonderful news with her acquaintances
that she forgot entirely the sirup she had brought for
Rossie’s throat, and would have forgotten to inquire after
Rossie herself if Aunt Axie had not accidentally put her
head in the door and given vent to a grunt of surprise
and disapprobation when she saw her in close conversation
with Josephine, and, with her knowledge of the
lady’s character for gossip, foresaw the result.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Miss Rider, is you here?” she said, advancing
into the room; “and does Miss Markham know it? I’ll
fotch her directly, ’cause Miss Ros’mon’s too sick to see
yer.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Never mind, Axie,” Mrs. Rider said, rising and beginning
to adjust her waterproof. “I drove up to inquire
after Rossie, and have spent more time than I
intended talking with Mrs. Forrest,” and she nodded
toward Josephine, who also arose and acknowledged the
nod and name with a gracious bow.</p>

<p class='c011'>She saw the impression she had made on her visitor,
who took her hand at parting, and said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“You will probably remain in Rothsay now, and I
shall hope to see a great deal of you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Again Josephine bowed assentingly to Mrs. Rider,
who at last left the room, followed by Axie, whose face
was like a thunder-cloud as she almost slammed the door
in the lady’s face in her anxiety to be rid of her.</p>

<div class='c010'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/di_252.jpg' width='100' alt=''>
</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
Before bed-time half the people in Rothsay
knew of the marriage, and that Mrs. Dr.
Rider had seen and talked with the lady, who
was reported as very beautiful, and young,
and stylish, and cultivated, and traveled, and
a Bostonian, whose family had been on the most intimate
terms with the Bigelows. She was also a friend of Bee
Belknap, who had spent a summer with her, and probably
knew of the marriage, which was a sort of escapade
gotten up on the spur of the moment, and kept a secret
at first because Everard was not through college, and
feared his father’s displeasure. But why it was not
made public after the judge’s death was a question which
even the wise ones could not answer; and so the wonder
and excitement increased.</p>

<p class='c011'>The next morning, which was Sunday, dawned clear
and bright. The rain was over, and at the usual hour
the Rothsayites betook themselves to their accustomed
place of worship. Trinity church was full that morning,
for though the people hardly expected Mrs. J. E. Forrest
herself, they did expect Mrs. Markham, and hoped to
hear something more from her. But Mrs. Markham was
not there, and the large, square pew which the Forrests
had occupied for many years, and which was far up the
middle aisle, was empty until the reading of the Psalms
commenced, when there was heard outside the sound of
rapidly approaching wheels, which stopped before the
door, and a moment after there entered a graceful figure
clothed in black, with the prettiest little Paris bonnet
perched on the golden hair, the long crape vail thrown
back, disclosing the fair, blonde face, which was a little
flushed, while the blue eyes had in them a timid, bashful
expression as they glanced quickly round in quest of the
sexton, who, having fulfilled his duties at the bell, had
gone to the organ loft, for he was blower as well as bell-ringer,
and left to others the task of seating strangers.
But Josey did not have to wait long, for four men,—two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>young, one middle-aged, and one white-haired and old,—simultaneously
left their pews and made a movement toward
her, the youngest reaching her first and asking if
she would have a seat.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, thank you. Please show me Judge Forrest’s
pew,” was the reply, and every head was turned as her
long skirts went trailing up the aisle, and the air was
filled with the costly and delicate perfume she carried
with her, and which was fresh from Pinaud’s.</p>

<p class='c011'>What a long time she remained upon her knees, and
how devout she was after she had arisen, and how clearly
and sweetly she sang the “Gloria,” and how wonderfully
her overskirt was looped, and how jauntily her jacket
fitted her, with such a pretty stand-up collar, and how
white her neck was above it, and how beautiful the wavy
hair under the lovely bonnet. All these details, and
more, were noted by every woman in church who could
get a view of her, while even the clergyman, good and
conscientious man as he was, found it difficult to keep
his eyes from straying too often to that crimson-cushioned
pew and the black-robed figure whose responses
were so audible and clear, and who seemed the very incarnation
of piety and innocence. He had heard of
Mrs. J. E. Forrest, and he guessed who the stranger was,
and when service was over he came down to speak to
her. Mrs. Rider, however, was there before him, and
was shaking hands with the lady, whom she presented
to the rector, and to his wife, and to several others who
sat near, and who involuntarily moved in that direction.</p>

<p class='c011'>And Josephine received them with a modesty of demeanor
which won their sympathy, if not their hearts,
at once. Not the slightest allusion did they make to her
husband, but she spoke of him herself, naturally and
easily. She had hoped to find him at home when she
came and have him present her to his friends, but unexpected
business had called him away, she believed. However,
he would soon return, as Miss Hastings had telegraphed
for him, and then she should not feel so much
alone.</p>

<p class='c011'>How very gentle and gracious she was, answering
all questions with great modesty, and without seeming
to volunteer any direct remarks, adroitly managing
to drop a good many scraps of information with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>regard to herself and her past life, all of course highly
advantageous to herself. Of Everard she said very little,
but when she did speak of him it was always as “My
husband, Mr. Forrest.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She should certainly expect him on the morrow, she
said, and then she should not feel so much like a stranger,
possibly an impostor, and she laughed a little musical
laugh, and her blue eyes sparkled so brightly and her
lips curled so prettily that every heart was won, and the
whole bevy of ladies followed her to the carriage telling
her they should call and see her very soon, stood watching
her as she drove away, and talked together of her
and her recreant husband, in whom there must be something
wrong, or he would long ago have acknowledged
this peerless woman as his wife. And so the talk increased
and every conceivable story was set afloat, and
poor Everard stood at rather a low ebb in public
opinion, when the six o’clock train came in the next day
and left him standing upon the platform, bewildered and
confounded with the words which greeted him as he left
the car, and which gave him the first intimation of what
he was to expect. The editor of the Rothsay <cite>Star</cite> was
standing there, and hitting Everard upon the shoulder,
exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hallo, Forrest. A nice trick you’ve been playing
upon us,—married all this time, and not let us know.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Married! What do you mean?” And Everard
turned white to his lips, while his friend replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“What do I mean? Why, I mean that your wife
is up at Forrest House, and thunder to pay generally.”</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
When Everard was interrupted in his interview
with Rosamond, his first feeling was one of
regret, for he had made up his mind to tell
her everything. He had held her in his arms
for one blissful moment, and pressed his lips
to her forehead, and the memory of that would help him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>to bear the wretchedness of all the after life. But before
he could begin his story, Lawyer Russell came in,
and the opportunity was lost. He could, however, write,
and he fully meant to do so, and after his arrival at
Dighton he began two or three letters, which he tore in
pieces, for he found it harder than he had expected to
confess that he had a wife to the girl he had kissed so
passionately, and who, he felt certain, loved him in return.
He had seen it in her eyes, which knew no deception,
and in the blushes on her cheek, and his greatest
pain came from the knowledge that she, too, must suffer
through him. And so he put off the writing day after
day, and employed his leisure moments in hunting up
the laws of Indiana on divorce, and felt surprised to find
how comparatively easy it was for those whom Heaven
had joined together to be put asunder by the courts of
man. Desertion, failure to support, uncongeniality, were
all valid reasons for breaking the bonds of matrimony;
and from reading and dwelling so much upon it he came
at last to consider it seriously as something which in his
case was excusable. Whatever Rossie might think of it
he should be happier to know the tie was broken, even
if the whole world disapproved; and he at last deliberately
made up his mind to free himself from the hated
marriage, which grew tenfold more hateful to him when
there came to his knowledge a fact which threw light at
once upon some things he had never been able to understand
in Dr. Matthewson.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was sitting one evening in the room devoted
mostly to the use of gentlemen at the hotel where he
was stopping, and listening in a careless kind of way to
the conversation of two men, one an inmate of the house,
and the other a traveler just arrived from western New
York. For a time the talk flowed on indifferent topics,
and drifted at last to Clarence, where it seemed that
both men had once lived, and about which the Dighton
man was asking some questions.</p>

<p class='c011'>“By the way,” he said, “whatever became of that
Matthewson, he called himself, though his real name
when I first knew him was Hastings. You know the
Methodist Church got pretty well bitten with him. He
was always the tallest kind of a rascal. I knew him
well.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>Everard was interested now, and while seeming to
read the paper he held in his hands, did not lose a word
of all which followed next.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Matthewson? Oh, yes, I know,” the Clarence man
replied. “You mean the fellow who was so miraculously
converted at a camp-meeting, and then took to preaching,
though a bigger hypocrite never lived. I don’t
know where he is now. He dabbled in medicine after
he left Clarence, and got “Doctor” hitched to his name,
and has been gambling through the country ever since.
The last I heard of him somebody wrote to Clarence
asking if he had a right to marry a couple, by which I
infer that he has been doing a little ministerial duty by
way of diversion.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I should hardly think a marriage performed by him
valid, though I dare say it would hold in court,” the
Dighton man, who was a lawyer, replied; adding, after
a moment, “Matthewson is the name of his aunt, which
he took at her death, together with a few thousands she
left him. His real name is John Hastings. I knew him
when he was a boy, and he was the most vindictive, unprincipled
person I ever met, and his father was not
much better, though both could be smooth as oil, and ingratiate
themselves into most anybody’s favor. He had
a girl in tow some two or three years ago, I was told; a
very handsome filly, but fast as the Old Nick himself, if,
indeed, she was not worse than that.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Here the conversation was brought to a close, and
Everard went to his room, where for a time he sat,
stunned and powerless to move. Like a flash of lightning
it came upon him just who Dr. Matthewson was,
and his mind went back to that night when, with a rash
boy’s impetuosity, he had raised his hand against the
mature man who, while smarting under the blows, had
sworn to be revenged. And he had kept his word, and
Everard could understand now why he had seemed so
willing and even anxious that there should be a perfect
understanding of the matter so as to make the marriage
valid.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Curse him!” Everard said to himself. “He meant
to ruin me. He could not have known what Josey was,
but he knew it was not a fitting match for me, and no
time or way for me to marry, if it were; but that was his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>revenge. I remember he asked me if I did not fear the
man whom I had punished, and said people like him did
not take cowhidings meekly; and he is Rossie’s <em>half-brother</em>;
but if I can help it, she shall never know how
he has injured me, the rascal. I’ll have a divorce now,
at all hazards, even though it may do me no good, so
far as Rossie is concerned. I’ll see that lawyer to-morrow
and tell him the whole story.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But before the morrow came, Everard received Mrs.
Markham’s telegram, which startled him so much that he
forgot everything in his haste to return home and see if
aught had befallen Rosamond. It had something to do
with her he was sure, but no thought that it had to do
with Josephine entered his mind until he stepped from
the car and heard that she was at the Forrest House.
For an instant his brain reeled, and he felt and acted like
a drunken man, as he went to claim his traveling-bag.
Then, without a word to any one, he walked rapidly
away in the darkness, with a face as white as the few
snow-flakes which were just beginning to fall, and a feeling
like death in his heart as he thought of Rossie left
alone to confront Joe Fleming as his wife. And yet it
did not seem very strange to him that Josephine was
there. It was rather as if he had expected it, just as the
murderer expects the day when his sin will find him out.
Everard’s sin had found him out, and as he sped along
the highway, half running in his haste to know the worst,
he was almost glad that the thing he had dreaded so long
had come at last, and to himself he said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll face it like a man, whatever the result may be.”</p>

<p class='c011'>From the windows of Rossie’s room a faint light was
shining, but it told him nothing of the sick girl lying
there, so nervous and excited that bright fever spots
burned on her cheeks, and her hands and feet were like
lumps of ice as she waited and listened for him, hearing
him the moment he struck the gravel-walk beneath her
window, for he purposely turned aside from the front
piazza, choosing to enter the house in the rear, lest he
should first encounter the woman, who, like Rossie,
was waiting and watching for him, and feeling herself
grow hot and cold alternately as she wondered what
he would say. Like Rossie, she was sure he would
come on that train, and had made herself as attractive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>as possible in her black cashmere and jet, with the white
shawl around her shoulders, and her golden hair falling
on her neck in heavy masses of curls. And then,
with a French novel in her hand, she sat down to wait
for the first sound of the carriage which was to bring
him, for she did not dream of his walking that cold, wet
night, and was not on the alert to see the tall figure
which came so swiftly through the darkness, skulking
like a thief behind the shrubbery till it reached the rear
door, where it entered, and stood face to face with old
Aunt Axie, who in her surprise almost dropped the bowl
of gruel she had been preparing for Rosamond. She
did spill it, she set it down so quickly, and putting both
her hands on Everard’s shoulders she exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Mars’r Everard, praise de Lord you am come at
last! I couldn’t b’ar it much longer, with Miss Rossie
sick up sta’rs, and that woman below swashin’ round
wid her long-tailed gowns, an’ her yaller ha’r hangin’
down her back, and sayin’ she is your wife. She isn’t
your wife, Mas’r Everard,—she isn’t?” and Axie looked
earnestly at the young man, who would have given
more than half his life to have been able to say, “No,
she is not.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But he could not do that, and his voice shook as he
replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, Aunt Axie, she is my wife.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Axie did not cry out or say a word at first, but her
black face quivered and her eyes filled with tears, as she
took a rapid mental survey of the case as it stood now.
Everard’s wife must of course be upheld for the credit of
the family, and, though the old negress knew there was
something wrong, it was not for her to inquire or to let
others do so either; and when at last she spoke, she
said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“If she’s your wife, then I shall stan’ by her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He did not thank her or seem to care whether she
stood by his wife or not, for his next question was:</p>

<p class='c011'>“You said Rosamond was sick. What is the matter?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sore throat and bad cold fust, and then your wife
comed an’ took us by surprise, an’ Miss Rossie fainted
cl’ar away, and has been as white, an’ still, an’ slimpsy
as a rag ever since.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>Something like a groan escaped from Everard’s lips,
as he said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Tell Miss Rossie I am here, and ask if I can see her,—at
once, before I meet anybody else.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I’ll tell her,” Axie said, as she hurried to the
room, where, to her great surprise, she found her young
mistress in her flannel dressing-gown and shawl, sitting
in her easy-chair, with her head resting upon pillows
scarcely whiter than her face, save where the red spots
of fever burned so brightly.</p>

<p class='c011'>In spite of Mrs. Markham’s remonstrance Rossie had
insisted upon getting up and being partly dressed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I must see Everard,” she said. “You can’t understand,
and I can’t explain, but he will come to me, and
I must see him alone.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes. Tell him to come up; I am ready for him,”
she said to Aunt Axie.</p>

<p class='c011'>And Everard advanced, with a sinking heart, and
knocked at Rossie’s door just as a black-robed figure,
with a white wool shawl wrapped around it, started to
come up the stairs.</p>

The voice which said “Come in” did not sound
like Rossie’s at all, nor did the little girl sitting
in the chair look much like the Rossie
he had last seen, flushed with health and happiness,
and the light of a great joy shining
in the eyes which now turned so eagerly toward him as
he came in. On the stairs outside there was the rustling
of skirts, and he heard it, and involuntarily slid the
bolt of the door, and then swiftly crossed to where Rossie’s
face was upturned to his with a smile of welcome,
and Rossie’s hands were both outstretched to him as she
said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Mr. Everard, I am glad you have come; we
have wanted you so much.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>He had thought she would meet him with coldness
and scorn for his weakness and duplicity, and he was
prepared for that, but not for this; and forgetting himself
utterly for the moment, he took the offered hands
and held them tightly in his own, until she released them
from him and motioned him to a seat opposite her,
where he could look into her face, which, now that he
saw it more closely, had on it such a grieved, disappointed
expression that he cried out:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Kill me, Rossie, if you will! but don’t look at me
that way, for I cannot bear it. I know what I’ve done
and what I am, better than you do.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Here he paused, and Rossie said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am sorry, Everard, that you did not tell me long
ago, when it first happened. Four years and more, she
says. I’ve been thinking it over, and it must have been
that time you came home when your mother died and
you were so sick afterward. You were married then.”</p>

<p class='c011'>How quietly and naturally she spoke the words
“married then,” as if it was nothing to her that he was
married <em>then</em> or <em>now</em>, but the hot blood flamed up for a
moment in her face and then left it whiter than before,
as Everard replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, if that can be called a marriage which was a
mere farce, and has brought nothing but bitter humiliation
to me, and been the cause of my ruin. I wish that
day had been blotted from my existence.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hush, Everard,” Rossie said. “You must not talk
that way, and your wife here in the house waiting for
you. I have not seen her yet, but they tell me she is
very beautiful.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, with that cursed beauty which lures men, or
rather fools, to their destruction; and I was a fool!”
Everard answered, bitterly,—“an idiot, who thought
myself in love. Don’t call her my wife, Rossie. She
has never been that; never will be. But I did not come
here to abuse her. I came to tell you the whole truth at
last, as I ought to have told it years ago, when my
mother was on her death-bed. I tried to tell her, but
I could not. I made a beginning by showing her
Josephine’s picture, which she did not like. The face
was pretty, she said, but not the face of a true, refined
woman, but rather of one who wore dollar jewelry,” and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>here Everard laughed sarcastically as he went on; “then
I showed the picture to Bee, who said she looked as if
she might wear cotton lace. But you, Rossie, said the
hardest thing of all, and decided me finally not to tell,
for I had almost made up my mind to make you my confidante.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I, Everard? I decided you? You must be mistaken.
When was it, Everard?” Rossie exclaimed, her
eyes growing very large and bright in her excitement.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you remember I once showed you a picture of a
young girl?” Everard said. “You were watering
flowers in the garden; and you said she was very beautiful,
but suggested that the jewelry, of which there was a
superfluity on her neck and arms, might be a sham, and
said she looked like a <em>sham</em>, too. How could I tell you
after that, that she was my wife? I couldn’t, and I kept
it to myself; and mother died, and I went crazy, and
you cut off your hair and sold it to pay what you believed
to be a gambling debt, and you wrote to Joe
Fleming, and I did not open my lips to undeceive you.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will have my say out,” he continued, fiercely, as
Rossie put up her hands to stop him; “I deserve a good
cudgeling, and I’ll give it to myself, for no one knows as
well as I do just what a sneaking coward I have been all
these years, when you have been believing in me and keeping
me from going to the——. No, I won’t swear; at least
before you, who have been my good angel ever since
you knew enough to chide me for my faults. Oh, Rossie!
what would I give to be put back to those old days
when I was comparatively innocent, and you, in your
cape sun-bonnet and long-sleeved aprons, were the dearest,
sweetest little girl in all the world, just as you are
now. I will say it, though I am killing you, I know, and
I am almost wicked enough not to care, for I would
rather there were no Rossie in this world than to know
she lived to hate and despise me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, Everard, never that, never!” and Rossie again
stretched toward him her pale little hands, which he
seized and held while he told her rapidly the whole story
of his marriage, beginning at the time he first saw Josey
Fleming and went to board with her mother.</p>

<p class='c011'>One item, however, he withheld. He did not tell her
that it was her half-brother who had married him, nor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>did he give the name of the clergyman. He would spare
her all pain in that direction, if possible, and let her
think as well as she could of the brother she could
scarcely remember, and who, she believed, must be dead,
or he would ere this have manifested some interest in
her.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of Josephine he spoke very plainly, and though he
did not exaggerate her faults, he showed conclusively,
in what he said, that his love for her had long since died
out, and he went on from one fact to another so rapidly that
Rossie felt stunned and bewildered and begged him to
stop. But he would not. She must hear him through, he
said, and at the close of his story she looked so white and
tired that he bent over her in alarm, chafing her cold
hands and asking what he could do for her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nothing but to leave me now,” she said. “I have
heard so much and borne so much that none of it seems
real. There’s a buzzing in my head, and I believe I’m
going to faint again, or die. How could you do all this,
and I trusted you so?—and, oh, Everard, where are you?
It grows so dark and black, and I’m so sick and faint,”
and with a sobbing, hysterical cry, Rossie involuntarily
let her tired, aching head fall upon the arm which held
it so gladly, and which fain would have kept it there
forever.</p>

<p class='c011'>Rossie did not faint quite away, as she had done
when the news of Everard’s marriage reached her, but
she lay still and helpless in Everard’s arms until she felt
his hot kisses upon her forehead, and that roused her
at once. He had no right to kiss her, she no right to
suffer it, and she drew herself away from him to the safe
shelter of her pillows, as she said, with her old childish
manner:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Everard, you must not kiss me like that. It is too
late. Such things are over between us now.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She seemed to accept the fact that he loved her, and
though the love was hopeless, and, turn which way she
would, there was no brightness in the future, the knowledge
of what might have been was in one sense very
sweet to her, and the face which Everard took between
his hands and looked earnestly into, while his lips quivered
and his eyes were full of tears, seemed to him like
the face of an angel.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>“Heaven pity me, Rossie,” he said. “Heaven pity
us both for this which lies between us.” There was a
knock outside the door and a voice Rossie had never
heard before, said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Miss Hastings, if my husband is with you, tell him
his wife will be glad to see him when he can tear himself
away. I have waited an hour, and surely I may claim
my own now.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was an unmistakable coarseness of meaning in
the words which brought the hot blood to Rossie’s cheeks,
but Everard was pale as death, as, with a muttered execration,
he stepped back from Rossie, who said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, go, Everard. She is right. Her claim is first.
Say I am sorry I kept you. Go, and when I have thought
it all out I’ll send for you, but don’t come till I do.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She motioned him to leave her, and with the look of
one going to the rack, he obeyed, and unbolting the
door, went out, shutting it quickly behind him, and thus
giving the woman outside no chance for more than a
glance at the white-faced little girl, of whose personal
appearance no impression could be formed.</p>

It had been Josephine’s intention to try and
make peace with her husband, if possible, in
the hope of winning him back to at least an
outward semblance of harmony. And to do
this she relied much on her beauty, which
she knew had not diminished in the least since those
summer days in Holburton, when he had likened her to
every beautiful thing in the universe. She knew she
was more attractive now than then, for she had studied
to acquire an air of refinement and high-breeding which
greatly enhanced her charms, and when she saw herself
in the long mirror, with her toilet complete, and the
made-up expression of sweetness and graciousness on her
face, she felt almost sure he could not withstand her.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>She had heard from Lois that Everard was in the
house, and as the moments went by and he did not come,
the sweetness left her face, and there was a glitter in her
blue eyes, as she walked impatiently up and down her
chamber, listening for his footsteps.</p>

<p class='c011'>At last, as she grew more and more impatient, she
went down to the dining-room, thinking to find him
there; but he was still with Axie in the kitchen, and so
she waited until she heard his step as he went rapidly up
the stairs.</p>

<p class='c011'>Swiftly and noiselessly she glided into the hall and
followed, but was only in time to see the shutting of the
door of Rossie’s room and hear the sliding of the bolt,
while her quick ear caught the sound of Rossie’s voice
as she welcomed Everard. For a moment Josephine
stood shaking with rage, and feeling an inclination to
kick at the closed door, and demand an entrance. But
she hardly dared do that, and so she waited, and
strained her ear to catch the conversation carried on so
rapidly, but in so low a tone and so far from her that
she could not hear it all, or even half. But she knew
Everard was telling the story of the marriage, and as he
grew more earnest his voice naturally rose higher, until
she could hear what he said, but not Rossie’s replies.
Involuntarily clenching her fists, and biting her lips until
the blood came through in one place, she listened still
more intently and knew there was no hope for her, and
felt sure that the only feeling she could now inspire in
her husband’s heart was one of hatred and disgust.</p>

<p class='c011'>At last, when she could endure the suspense no longer,
she knocked upon the door and claimed “her own” and
got it, for her husband, whom she had not seen for more
than two years, stood face to face with her, a tall, well-developed
man, with a will and a purpose in his brown
eyes, and a firm-set expression about his mouth which
made him a very different person from the boy-lover
whom she had swayed at her pleasure.</p>

<p class='c011'>Everard was a thorough gentleman, and it was not
in his nature to be otherwise than courteous to any
woman, and he bowed to Josephine with as much politeness
and deference as if it had been Bee Belknap standing
there so dignified and self-possessed, and with an air
of assurance and worldly wisdom such as he had never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>seen in Josephine Fleming. For a moment he looked at
her in surprise, but there was no sign of welcome in his
face, no token of admiration for the visible improvement
in her. He had an artist’s eye, and noticed that her
dress was black, and that it became her admirably, and
that the delicate white shawl was so knotted and arranged
as to heighten the effect of the picture; but he
knew the woman so well that nothing she could do or
wear could move him now. When she saw that she
must speak first, she laughed a little, spiteful laugh, and
said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Have you nothing to say to me after two years’
separation, or have you exhausted yourself with <em>her</em>?”
nodding toward Rossie’s door.</p>

<p class='c011'>That roused him, and he answered her:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, much to say, and some things to explain and
apologize for, but not here. I will go with you to your
room. They tell me you are occupying my old quarters.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He tried to speak naturally, and Josephine’s heart
beat faster as she thought that possibly he might be won
to an outward seeming of friendship after all, and it
would be better for her every way. So, when the privacy
of her chamber was reached, and there was no
danger of interruption, she affected the loving wife, and
laying her hands on Everard’s arm, said, coaxingly and
prettily:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t be so cold and hard, Everard, as if you were
sorry I came. I had nowhere else to go, and I’m no
more to blame for being your wife than you are for
being my husband, and I certainly have just cause to
complain of you for having kept me so long in ignorance
of your father’s death. Why did you do it? But I
need not ask why,” she continued, as she saw the frown
on his face, and guessed he was not to be coaxed; “the
reason is in the apartment you have just quitted.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Josephine got no further, for Everard interrupted
her and sternly bade her stop.</p>

<p class='c011'>“So long as you censure me for having kept my
father’s death a secret from you I am bound to listen, for
I deserve it; but when you assail Rosamond Hastings
you have gone too far. I do not wish to quarrel with
you, Josey, but we may as well understand each other
first as last. You had a right to come here, thinking it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>was still my home, and I am justly punished for my deceit,
for which no one can hate me as I hate myself. If
I had been candid and frank from the first, it would
have saved me a great deal of trouble and self-abasement.
You heard of my father’s death——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, but no thanks are due you for the information.
Mr. Everts, whom I met in Dresden, told me of it. At
first I did not believe him, for I had credited you with
being a man of honor, but he convinced me of the fact,
and in my anger I started home at once, and came here,
to find that girl the mistress of the house, and, they tell
me, your father’s heir. Is that true?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ve nothing but what I earn,” he said, “but I
think I have proved conclusively that I can support you,
whatever may come to me, and I expect to do so still,
but it must be apart from myself. I wish that distinctly
understood, as it will save further discussion. You
could not be happy with me; I should be miserable with
you after knowing what I do, and seeing what I have
seen.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Here she turned fiercely upon him, and with flashing
eyes and dilated nostrils demanded what he meant.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will tell you when I reach it,” he replied; “but
first, let me go over the ground from the beginning——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No need of that,” she replied, angrily. “You went
over the ground with <em>her</em>,—that girl whom I hate with
deadly hatred. I heard you. I was outside the door.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Listening!” Everard said, contemptuously. “A
worthy employment, to which no lady would stoop.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who said I was a lady?” she retorted, stung by his
manner and the tone of his voice, and forgetting herself
entirely in her wrath. “Don’t you suppose I know
that it was because I was <em>not</em> a lady according to your
creed that your father objected to me and that <em>you</em> have
sickened of me. A poor, unknown butcher’s daughter is
not a fit match for you; and I was just that. You
thought you married the daughter of Roxie Fleming,
who kept a boarding-house, and so you did, and something
more. You married the daughter of the man who
used to deliver meat at your grandfather’s door in Boston,
and of the woman who for years cooked in your
mother’s family. I knew this when you first came to us,
and laughed in my sleeve, for I know how proud you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>are of family blood and birth, and I can boast of blood,
too, but it is the blood of beasts, in which my father
dealt, not the blue-veined kind, which shows itself in
hypocrisy and the deliberate deception of years. I told
your father, when I met him at Commencement, that my
mother was present at his wedding, and she was. She
made the jellies and ices, and stood with the other servants
to see the ceremony. Wouldn’t your lady mother
turn over in her coffin if she could know <em>just</em> whom her
boy married?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Was she a woman, or a demon? Everard wondered, as
he replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“If possible, I would rather not bring my mother
into the conversation, but since you will have it so, I
must tell you that she <em>did</em> know who you were.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How! did you tell your mother of the marriage,
and have you kept that from me, too?” Josephine asked,
and he replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I did not tell her of the marriage, although I tried
to, and made a beginning by showing her your picture, and
telling her your name and that of your mother,
whom she at once identified as the Roxie who had lived
in her father’s family so long.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And of course my fine lady objected to such stock,”
Josephine said, with a sneer in her voice.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Josephine,” and Everard spoke more sternly than
he had ever spoken to her in his life, “say what you
like to me, but don’t mention my mother in that tone or
spirit again. She did not despise you for your birth.
No true woman would do that. She said that innate refinement
or delicacy of feeling would always assert itself,
and raise one above the lowest and humblest of positions.
Almost her last words to me were of you, in whom she
knew I was interested, for I had confessed as much.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘If she is so good, and womanly, and true, her birth
is of no consequence—none whatever,’ she said. So
you see she laid less stress upon it than do you, who
know better than she did whether you are good, and
womanly and true.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Here Josephine began to cry, but Everard did not
heed her tears, and went on:</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is in this country no degradation in honest
labor; it is the character, the actions, which tell; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>were you what I believed you to be when in my madness
I consented to that foolish farce, I would not care
though your origin were the lowest which can be conceived.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Here Josephine stopped crying, and demanded,
sharply:</p>

<p class='c011'>“What am I, pray? What do you know of me?—you,
who have scarcely seen me half a dozen times since
I became your wife.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know more than you suppose,—have seen more
than you guess,” he replied; “but let me begin with the
morning I left you in Holburton, four years ago last
June, and come down to the present time.”</p>

<p class='c011'>When he hinted that he knew more of her life than
she supposed, there instantly flashed into Josephine’s
mind the memory of all the love affairs she had been
concerned in, and the improprieties of which she had
been guilty, and she wondered if it were possible that
Everard could know of them, too. But it was not, and,
assuming a calmness she was far from feeling, she said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Go on, I am all attention.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Very rapidly, Everard went over with the events of
his life as connected with her up to the time of his
father’s death and his own disinheritance, and here he
paused a moment, while Josephine said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“And so it was through me you lost your money. I
am very sorry, and I must say I think it mean in that
girl to keep it, knowing as she does how it came to her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You misjudge her,” Everard said, quickly. “You
know nothing of her, or how she rebelled against it and
tried to give it back to me. But she cannot do it while
she is under age, and I would not take it if she could. I
made her believe it at last, and then counseled with Miss
Belknap as to my future course——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Miss Belknap, indeed!” Josephine exclaimed, indignantly.
“Don’t talk to me of Miss Belknap, the
tricky, deceitful thing, to come into our house, knowing
all the time who I was, and yet pretending such entire
ignorance of everything. How I hate her, and you, too,
for sending her there as a spy upon my actions.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are mistaken,” Everard said. “Bee was no
tale-bearer, and no spy upon your actions. Neither was
she sent to you, for I did not know she was there till she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>wrote me to that effect. She had the best of motives
in going to your mother’s house. She wished to see you
for herself, and,—pardon me, Josey, if I speak very
plainly,—she wished to find all the good there was in
you, so as to know better how to befriend you, should
you need it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Which, thank Heaven, I don’t, so she had her
trouble for her pains,” was Josephine’s rejoinder, of
which Everard took no notice, but simply went on:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Beatrice has been your best friend from the moment
she first heard of you, and after father’s death she
advised me to go straight to you and tell you the whole
truth, and offer you a home such as I could make for
you myself,—in short, offer you poverty and protection
as my acknowledged wife.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Strange you did not follow her advice, with your
high notions of morality,” Josephine said, with a sneer;
and he replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I started to do it in good faith, and went as far as
Albany without a thought that I should not do it, but
there I began to waver, for I saw you, myself unseen
and my presence unsuspected, so that you acted and
spoke your feelings without restraint.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Perhaps you can recall a concert or opera which you
attended with Doctor Matthewson as your escort, and
perhaps, though that is not so likely, you may remember
the man who seemed to be asleep in the seat behind the
one you took when you entered the car, talking and
laughing so loudly that you drew to yourself the attention
of all the passengers, and especially the young man,
who listened with feelings which can be better imagined
than described, while his <em>wife</em> made light of him, and
allowed attentions and liberties such as no pure-minded
woman would for a moment have suffered from any man,
and much less from one of Dr. Matthewson’s character.
I hardly know what restrained me from knocking him
down and publicly denouncing you, but shame and disgust
kept me silent, while words and glances which
made my blood boil passed between you two until <em>you</em>
were tired out and laid you head on his arm as readily
as you would have rested it on mine had I sat in his
place. And there I left you asleep, and I have never
looked upon your face since until to-night, when I found
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>you at Miss Hastings’ door. After that scene in the car
I could not think of offering to share my poverty with
you. We were better apart, and I made a vow that
never for an hour would I live with you as my wife.
The thing is impossible; but because I dreaded the notoriety
of an open rupture, and the talk and scandal sure
to follow an admission of the marriage, I kept quiet,
trusting to chance to work it out for me as it has done
at last. And now that the worst has come, I am ready
to abide by it and am willing to bear the blame myself,
if that will help you any. The people in Rothsay will
undoubtedly believe you the injured party, and I shall
let them do so. I shall say nothing to your detriment
except that it is impossible for us to live together. I
shall support you just as I have done, but I greatly prefer
that it should be in Holburton, rather than in Rothsay.
It is the only favor I ask, that you do not remain
here.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And one I shall not grant,” was Josephine’s quick
reply. “I like Rothsay, so far as I have seen it, and
here I shall stay. Do you think that I will go back to
Holburton, and bear all the malicious gossip of that
gossipy hole? Never! I’ll die first! You accuse me
of being fond of Dr. Matthewson, and so I am, and I
like him far better than I ever liked you, for he is a <em>gentleman</em>,
while you are a knave and a hypocrite, and that
girl across the hall is as bad as you are;—I hate her,—I
hate you both!”</p>

<p class='c011'>She was standing close to him now, her face livid
with rage, while the blue of her eyes seemed to have
faded into a dull white, as she gave vent to her real
feelings. But Everard did not answer her, and as the
dinner-bell just then rang for the third time, she added
sneeringly, “If you are through with your abuse I’ll end
the interview by asking you to take me down to dinner.
No? You do not wish for any dinner? Very well, I
can go alone, so I wish you good evening, advising you
not to fast too long. It is not good for you. Possibly
you may find some cracker and tea in Miss Hastings’
room, with which to refresh the inner man.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And sweeping him a mocking courtesy she started to
leave the room, but at the door she met her sister, and
stopped a moment while she said:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>“Ah, Agnes, here is your brother, who, I hope, will
be better pleased to see you than he was to see me. If I
remember rightly you were always his favorite. <i><span lang="fr">Au revoir</span></i>,”
and kissing the tips of her fingers to Everard, she
left the room, and he heard her warbling snatches of
some old love song as she ran lightly down the stairs to
the dining-room, where dinner had waited nearly an
hour, and where Aunt Axie stood with her face blacker
than its wont, giving off little angry snorts as she removed
one after another the covers of the dishes, and
pronounced the contents spoiled.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Whar’s Mars’r Everard? Isn’t he comin’?” Aunt
Axie asked, as Josephine showed signs of commencing
her dinner alone, Mrs. Markham, who ate by rule and on
time, having had tea and cold chicken, and gone.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mr. Forrest has lost his appetite and is not coming,”
Josephine replied, with the utmost indifference, and as
Agnes just then appeared, the sisters began their dinner
alone.</p>

<p class='c011'>But few words had passed between Agnes and Everard.
She had taken his hand in hers and held it there
while she looked searchingly in his face, and said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I didn’t want to come, but she would have it so,
and I thought you knew and had sent for her. Maybe I
can persuade her to go back.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, Aggie, let her do as she likes,—I deserve it all.
But don’t feel badly, Aggie. I am glad to see <em>you</em>, at
any rate, and I feel better because you are here; and
now go to the dinner, which has waited so long.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Agnes was not deceived in the least, and her heart
was very heavy as she went down to the dining-room
and took her seat by her sister, who affected to be so
gay and happy, and who tried to soften old Axie by
praising everything immoderately.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Axie was not deceived, either. She knew it was
not all well between the young couple, and as soon as she
had sent in the dessert, she started up stairs in quest of her
boy, finding him in the chamber where his mother had
died, and kneeling by the bed in such an abandonment
of grief that, without waiting to consider whether she
was wanted or not, she went softly to his side, and laying
her hard old hands pityingly on his bowed head,
spoke to him lovingly and soothingly, just as she used to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>speak to him when he was a little boy, and sat in her
broad lap to be comforted.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thar, thar, honey; what is it that has happened
you? Suffin dreffle, or you wouldn’t be kneelin’ here in
de cold an’ dark, wid only yer mother’s sperrit for company.
What is it, chile? Can’t you tell old Axie? Is
it <em>her</em> that’s a vexin’ you so? Oh, Mars’r Everard, how
could you do it? Tell old Axie, won’t you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>And he did tell her how the marriage occurred, and
when, and that it was this which had caused the trouble
between him and his father. He said nothing against
Josephine, except that he had lived to see and regret his
mistake, and that it was impossible for him to live with
her as his wife. And Axie took his side at once, and
replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“In course you can’t, honey, I seen that the fust
thing. She hain’t like you, nor Miss Beatrice, nor Miss
Rossie. She’s pretty, with them eyes and long winkers,
an’ she’s kind of teterin’ an’ soft; but can’t cheat dis
chile. ’Tain’t the real stuff like your mother was.
Sposin’ I go and paint my face all over with whitenin’.
I ain’t white for all dat. Thar’s nobody but ole black
nigger under de whitewash, for bless your soul, de thick
lips and de wool will show, an’ it’s just de same with no
’count white folks. But don’t you worry, I’ll stan’ by
you. Course you can’t live with her. I’ll make a fire
an’ fetch you some supper, an’ you’ll feel better in de
mornin’,—see if you don’t.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But Everard asked to be left alone, that he might
think it out and decide what to do. He could not go to
bed, and so he sat the entire night before the fire in the
room where his mother had died, and where his father
had denounced him so angrily, and where Rosamond
had come to him and asked to be his wife. How vividly
that last scene came up before him, and he could almost
see the little girl standing there again, just as she stood
that day, which seemed to him years and years ago.
And but for that fatal misstep that little girl, grown to
sweet womanhood, now might have been his. Turn
which way he would, there was no help, no hope; and
the future loomed up before him dark and cheerless,
with always this burden upon him, this bar to the happiness
which might have been his had he only waited for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>it. Surely, if his sin was great, his punishment was
greater, and when at the last the gray morning looked
in at the windows of his room, it found him white, and
haggard, and worn, with no definite plan as to his future
course, except the firm resolve that whatever his life
might be, it would be passed apart from Josephine.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XXXVI.<br> <span class='large'>ROSAMOND’S DECISION.</span></h2>
</div>

<div class='c010'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/di_273.jpg' width='100' alt=''>
</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
Rosamond had sent word to Everard that she
would see him after breakfast, and he went
to her at once, finding her sitting up just as
she was the previous night, but much paler,
and more worn-looking, as if she had not
slept in months. But the smile with which she greeted
him was as sweet and cordial as ever, and in the eyes
which she fixed so steadily upon him he saw neither
hatred nor disgust, but an expression of unutterable
sorrow and pity for him, and for herself, too, as well.
Rossie was not one to conceal her feelings. She was
too much a child, too frank and ingenuous for that, and
there was a great and bitter pain in her heart which she
could not hide. Everard had never said in words that
he loved her, but she had accepted it as a fact, and when
her dream was so rudely dispelled she could no more
conceal her disappointment than she could hide the ravages
of sickness so visible upon her face.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ve been thinking it all over,” she began, as he sat
down beside her, “and though my opinion may not be
worth much, I hope you will consider it, at least, and
give it some thought before deciding not to adopt it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He guessed what was coming, and nerved himself to
keep quiet while she went on:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Everard, she is your wife. You cannot undo that,
except in one way, and that you must not take, for it is
wicked and wrong. You loved her once. You say you
were quite as much to blame for the marriage as she,
and you know you have been wrong in keeping it a secret
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>so long. She has just cause for complaint, and I want
you to try to love her again. You <em>must</em> support her, and
it will be so much better, and save so much talk and gossip
if you live in the same house with her,—in this house,
your rightful home.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Never, Rossie!” he exclaimed, vehemently, “never
can I make her really my wife, feeling as I do. It would
be a sin, and a mockery, and I shall not do it. You say
I loved her once; perhaps I did, though it seems to me
now like a child’s fancy for some forbidden dainty,
which, if obtained, cloys on the stomach and sickens one
ever after. No, Rossie, you talk in vain when you ask
me to live with Josephine as my wife, or even live with
her at all. The same roof cannot shelter us both. Support
her I shall, but live with her, never! and I am prepared
for all the people will say against me. If I have
your respect and sympathy I can defy the world, though
the future looks very dreary to me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>His voice trembled as he spoke, and he leaned back
in his chair as if he, too, were faint and sick, while Rossie
continued:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then, if you will not live with her under any circumstances,
this is my next best plan. Forrest House is her
natural home, and she must stay here, whatever you may
do.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Here, Rossie! Here with you! Are you crazy?”
Everard exclaimed, and Rosamond replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am going away. I have thought it all over, and
talked with Mrs. Markham. She has a friend in St.
Louis who is wanting a governess for her three children,
and she is going to write to-day and propose me, and if
the lady consents, I,—I am going away.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Rossie finished the sentence with a long drawn
breath, which sounded like a sob, for this going away
from all she loved best was as hard for her as for Everard,
who felt suddenly as if every ray of sunlight had
been stricken from his life. With Rossie gone the world
would be dark indeed, and for a few moments he used
all his powers of eloquence to dissuade her from the
plan, but she was quite resolved, and he understood it at
last, and answered her:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Perhaps you are right; but Heaven pity me when
you are gone!”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>For a moment Rosamond was silent, and then she
said, in her usual frank way:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, Everard, I understand, or I think I do, and it
would be foolish in me to pretend <em>not</em> to know,—to believe,—I
mean,” and the bright color began to mount to
Rossie’s cheeks as she went on: “I mean that I believe
you do care for me some,—that if I were dead you
would remember me longer than any one else. I guess
you like me a little, don’t you, Everard?”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was the child Rossie,—the little girl of his boyhood,—who
spoke with all her old simple-heartedness of
manner, but the face which looked up at the young man
was not the face of a child, for there was written on it
all a woman’s first tenderness and love, and the dark
eyes were full of tears, and the parted lips quivered even
after she ceased to speak, and sat looking at him as fearlessly
and as little abashed as she had looked at him
when she asked to be his wife. And how could he
answer that question so innocently put? “You do like
me a little, don’t you, Everard?” How, but to stoop and
kiss the quivering lips which kissed him back again
unhesitatingly, but when he sought to wind his arms
around her, and hold her closely to him, she motioned
him away, and said: “No, Everard, you might kiss me
once, and I might kiss you back, as we would do if either
of us were dying, and it was our farewell to each other,
as this is. I can never kiss you again, never; nor you
me, nor say anything like what we have been saying.
Remember that, Everard. The might have been is past,
and when we meet, as we sometimes may, it will be on
the old footing, as guardian and ward, or brother and
sister, if you like that better. And now listen, while I
finish telling you what my wishes are with regard to the
future.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Rosamond’s was the stronger spirit then, and she
compelled him to sit quietly by and hear her while she
planned the future for him. Josephine was to live at
Forrest House, and to receive a certain amount of income
over and above the support which he would give
her. But to this last he stoutly objected. Not one dollar
of Rossie’s money should ever find its way to her, he
said. He could support her with his profession, and if
Rossie did not choose to use what was rightly her own it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>would simply accumulate on her hands, without doing
good to any one.</p>

<p class='c011'>So Rossie gave that project up, but insisted that she
should vacate the house as soon as she was able, and
leave Josephine in possession, and Everard was commissioned
to tell her so, and to say that she must excuse
Miss Hastings from seeing her until she was stronger,
and that she must feel perfectly at home, and free to
ask for whatever she liked.</p>

<p class='c011'>At first Josie listened incredulously to Everard; it
seemed so improbable that Rossie would deliberately
abandon her handsome home, and give it up to her.
But he succeeded in making her understand it at last,
taking great care to let her know that she was to have
nothing from the Forrest estate except the rent of the
house; that for everything else she was dependent upon
him, who could give her a comfortable support, but
allow nothing like luxury or extravagance.</p>

<p class='c011'>To this Josephine assented, and was gracious enough
to say that it was very kind and generous in Miss Hastings,
and to express a wish that she might see her and
thank her in person. But to this Everard gave no encouragement.
Miss Hastings was very weak, he said,
and had already been too much excited, and needed perfect
quiet for the present. Of course, so long as she remained
there she would be mistress of the house, and
Josephine her guest. For himself, he should return to
his old quarters in town, and only come to the house
when it was necessary to do so on business. If Josephine
was needing money, he had fifty dollars which he
could give her now, and more would be forthcoming
when that was gone.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nothing could have been more formal than this interview
between the husband and wife, and after it was
over Josephine sat down to write to Mrs. Arnold in
Europe, while Everard went boldly out to face the world
waiting so eagerly for him.</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
If Josephine had not known herself to be worse
even than Everard had charged her with
being, she might not have submitted so
quietly to the line of conduct he proposed to
pursue toward her, but the consciousness of
misdeeds, known only to herself, made her manageable,
and willing to accept the conditions offered her. Had
Rosamond been allowed to give her a part of her income
she would have taken it as something due to her, but as
that was forbidden she was well satisfied with the house
and its surroundings, and the support her husband could
give her. To return to Holburton, after having announced
publicly that she was going to her husband,
would have been a terrible mortification, and something
which she declared to herself she would never have done,
and so she resolved to make the most of the situation in
Rothsay. To stand well with the people in town was
her great object now, and to that end every art and
grace of which she was capable was brought into requisition,
and so well did she play her part that a few of
the short-sighted ones, with Mrs. Dr. Rider at their head,
espoused her cause and looked askance at Everard, who
kept his own counsel, with the single exception of Lawyer
Russell, to whom he told his story, and who assumed
such an air of reserve and dignity that not even his most
intimate friends dared approach him on the subject
which was interesting every one so much.</p>

<p class='c011'>Everard knew that he was an object of suspicion and
gossip, but cared little or nothing for it, so absorbed was
he in his own trouble, and in watching the progress of
affairs at the Forrest House, where Josephine was to all
intents and purposes the mistress, issuing her orders and
expressing her opinions and wishes with far more freedom
than Rossie had ever done. She, too, was very reticent
with regard to her husband, and when Mrs. Dr.
Rider asked in a roundabout way what was the matter,
she replied, in a trembling voice:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>“Oh, I don’t know, except he grew tired of me during
the years we were separated; but please don’t talk
to me about it, or let any one else, for I cannot speak of
it,—it makes me so sick.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She did act as if she were going to faint, and Mrs.
Rider opened the window and let in the cool air, and
told Josephine to lean on her till she was better, and
then reported the particulars of her interview so graphically
and well that after a day or so everybody had
heard that poor Mrs. Forrest, when asked as to the cause
of the estrangement between herself and husband, had
at once gone into hysterics and fainted dead away. Of
course the curious ones were more curious than ever,
and tried old Axie next, but she was wholly non-committal,
and bade them mind their business and let their
betters alone.</p>

<p class='c011'>Rosamond was now the last hope, but she had nothing
to say whatever, except that under the circumstances she
felt that Mrs. Forrest at least ought to live at her husband’s
old home, and that arrangements to that effect
had been made. As for herself, it had been her intention
to teach for a long time, and as Mrs. Markham declared
her competent, she was going to try it, and leave
the place to Mrs. Forrest. Nothing could be learned
from Rossie, who was too great a favorite with everyone
to become a subject of gossip; and whatever might be
the cause of the trouble between Everard and Josey, her
spotless, innocent life was too well known for any censure
to fall on her, and Josephine could not have reached
her by so much as a breath of calumny, had she chosen
to try, which she did not. With her quick intuition she
understood at once how immensely popular Rossie was,
and resolving to be friends with her, if possible, she
waited anxiously for a personal interview, which was accorded
her at last, and the two met in Rossie’s room,
where, in her character as invalid, Rossie sat in her easy-chair,
with her beautiful hair brushed back from her
pure, pale face, and her great, black eyes unusually brilliant
with excitement and expectation.</p>

<p class='c011'>Josephine, too, had been almost as nervous with regard
to this interview as Rosamond herself, and had spent an
hour over her toilet, which was perfect in all its details,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>from the arrangement of her hair to her little high-heeled
slippers with the fanciful rosettes.</p>

<p class='c011'>Rosamond was prepared for something very pretty,
but not as beautiful as the woman who came half hesitatingly,
half eagerly, into the room, and stood before
her with such a bright, winning smile upon her lovely
face that it was hard to believe there was guile or artfulness
there. Rising to her feet Rossie offered her hand
to her visitor, who took it and pressed it to her lips,
while she said something about the great happiness it
was to see one of whom she had heard so much.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, I used actually to be half jealous of the Rossie
Everard was always talking about,” she said, referring
to the past as easily and naturally as if no cloud had
ever darkened her horizon, or come between her and the
Everard who had talked so much of Rossie.</p>

<p class='c011'>When Josephine first entered the room Rossie was
very pale, but at this allusion to herself and Everard
there came a flush to her cheeks and a light to her eye
which made Josephine change her mind with regard to
her personal appearance.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nobody can ever call her a beauty,” she had said to
herself at first, but as the interview progressed, and
Rossie grew interested and earnest, Josephine looked
wonderingly at her glowing face and large black eyes,
which flashed and shone like stars, and almost bewildered
and confused her with their brightness, and the way they
had of looking straight at her, as if to read her inmost
thoughts.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was impossible to suspect Rossie of acting or saying
anything she did not mean, for her face was like a
clear, faithful mirror, and after a little Josephine began
to grow ill at ease in her presence. The bright black
eyes troubled her a little when fixed so earnestly upon
her, and she found herself wondering if they could penetrate
her inmost thoughts, and see just what she was. It
was a singular effect which Rossie had upon this woman,
whose character was one web of falsehoods and deceit,
and who, in the presence of so much purity and innocence,
and apparent trust in everybody, was conscious of
some new impulse within her, prompting her to a better
and sincerer life. Wondering how much Rossie knew of
her antecedents, she suddenly burst out with:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>“Miss Hastings, or Rossie,—I so much wish you’d let
me call you by the name I have heard so often. I want
to tell you at once how I have hated myself for taking
that money, the price of your lovely hair, and letting
you believe I was a dreadful gambler, seeking Everard’s
ruin.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She had her hand on the “lovely hair,” and was passing
her white fingers through it and letting it fall in
curling masses about Rossie’s neck and shoulders, as she
went on:</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was such a funny mistake you made with regard
to me, and it was wrong in me to take the money. I
would not do it now; but we were so poor, and I needed
it so much, and Everard could not get it. Has he told
you all about those times, I wonder, when we were first
married, and he did love me a little.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He has told me a good deal,” was Rossie’s straightforward
answer; and sitting down upon a stool in front
of her Josey assumed the attitude and manner of a child
as she went on to speak of the past, and to beg Rossie
to think as leniently of her as possible.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Men are not always correct judges of women’s
actions,” she said, “and I do not think Everard understands
me at all. Our marriage in that hasty manner
was unwise, but if I erred I surely have paid the severest
penalty. Such things fall more heavily upon women
than upon men, and I dare say you think better of
Everard this moment than you do of me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Rossie could not say she didn’t, for there was something
in Josephine’s manner which she did not like.
It seemed to be all acting, and to one who never acted
a part, it was very distasteful. But she tried to evade
the direct question by answering: “I have known Everard
so long that I must of course think better of him
than of a stranger. He has been so kind to me;” then,
wishing to turn the conversation into a channel where
she felt she should be safer, she plunged at once into her
plan of leaving the house to Josephine, saying that she
had never thought it right for her to have it, and speaking
of the judge’s last illness, when she was certain he
repented of what he had done.</p>

<p class='c011'>At first Josephine made a very pretty show of protesting
against it.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>“It is <em>your own</em> home,” she said, “and though I appreciate
your great kindness, I cannot feel that it is
right to take it from you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But I thought you understood that it was quite a
settled thing that I am to go away, as I have always intended
doing. Everard told you so. Surely he explained
it to you,” Rossie said, in some surprise.</p>

<p class='c011'>Josephine did not quite know how to deal with a nature
like Rossie’s, but she guessed that for once it would
be necessary for her to say very nearly what she thought,
and so for a few moments the two talked together earnestly
and soberly of the future, when Rossie would be
gone and Josephine left in charge.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You will only be taking what is yours a little in advance,”
Rossie said, “for when I am of age I shall deed
it back to Everard; and then, on the principle that what
is a man’s is also his wife’s, it will be yours, and I hope
that long before that it will be well with you and
Everard; that the misunderstanding between you will be
cleared up; that he will do right, and if,—if,—you are conscious
of any defect in your character which annoys him,
you will overcome it and try to be what he would like
his wife to be, for you might be so happy with him, if
only you loved each other.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The great black eyes were full of tears, and Rossie’s
face twitched painfully as she compelled herself to make
this effort in Everard’s behalf. But it was lost on Josephine,
who, thoroughly deceitful and treacherous herself,
could not believe that this young girl really meant what
she said; it was a piece of acting to cover her real feeling,
but she affected to be touched, and wiped her own
eyes, and said despondingly that the time was past, she
feared, the opportunity lost for her to regain her husband.
He did not care for her any longer; his love was
given to another, and she looked straight at Rossie, who
neither spoke nor made a sign that she heard or understood,
but she looked so very white and tired that Josephine
arose to go, after thanking her again for her kindness
and generosity, and assuring her that everything
about the house should be kept just as she left it, and
that in case she changed her mind after trying the life
of a governess, and wished to return, she must do so
without any reference to her convenience or pleasure.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>And so the interview ended, and Josephine went
back to her room and Agnes, to whom she said that she
had found Miss Hastings rather pretty, and that she
was on the whole a nice little body, and had acted very
well about the house, “though,” she added:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I consider it quite as much mine as hers. That old
man was crazy, or he would never have left everything
to her, and he tried afterward to take it back, it seems,
and right the wrong he had done. She told me all about
it, and how his eyes followed her, and shut and opened
as she talked to him. It made me so nervous to think of
those eyes; I believe they will haunt me forever. And
Everard never told me that, but let me believe his father
died just as angry with him as ever. I tell you, Agnes,
I am beginning to hate that man quite as much as he
hates me, and if I were sure of as comfortable a living
and as good a position elsewhere as he can give me here,
I’d sue for a divorce to-morrow, and get it, too, and
then,—‘away, away, to my love who is over the sea.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>She sang the last words in a light, flippant tone,
and then sat down to write to Dr. Matthewson, whose
last letter, received before she left Europe, was still
unanswered.</p>

<p class='c011'>Three weeks after this interview Rosamond left Rothsay
for St. Louis, where she was to be governess to
Mrs. Andrews’ children on a salary of three hundred
dollars a year. Everard and Josephine both went to
the depot to see her off, the one driving down in the
carriage with her, and making a great show of regret
and sorrow, the other walking over from his office, and
maintaining the utmost reserve and apparent indifference,
as if the parting were nothing to him; but at the
last, when he stood with Rossie’s hand in his, there came
a look of anguish into his eyes, and his lips were deathly
white as he said good-by, and knew that all which made
life bearable to him was leaving him, forever.</p>

<div class='c010'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/di_283.jpg' width='100' alt=''>
</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
It was the first of January when Rossie left
Rothsay for St. Louis, and three weeks from
that day a wild storm was sweeping over the
hills of Vermont, and great clouds of sleet
and snow went drifting down into the open
grave in Bronson church-yard, toward which a little
group of mourners was slowly wending its way. Neither
Florida skies nor Florida air had availed to restore
life and health to poor wasted, worn-out Mollie Morton,
although at first she seemed much better, and Trix
and Bunchie, in their childish way, thanked God, who
was making their mamma well, while the Rev. Theodore,
in Boston, felt something like new hope within him
at the cheerful letters Mollie wrote of what Florida was
doing for her. But the improvement was only temporary,
and neither orange blossoms or southern sunshine
could hold the spirit which longed so to be free, and
which welcomed death without a shadow of fear.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have had much to make me happy,” Mollie said
to Beatrice, one day, when that faithful friend sat by her
holding the tired head upon her bosom, and gently
smoothing the once black hair, which now was more
than three-fourths gray, though Mollie was only thirty-one.
“Two lovely children, and the kindest, best husband
in the world,—the man I loved and wanted so
much, and who I think, likes me, and will miss me some
when I am gone forever.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This she said, looking straight at Beatrice, whose face
was very pale as she stooped to kiss the white forehead
and answered:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am sure he will miss you, and so shall I, for I have
learned to love you so much, and shall be so sorry when
you are gone.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Truly, truly, will you be sorry when I am dead? I
hardly thought anybody would be that but father and
mother, and the children,” Mollie said, while the lips
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>quivered and the great tears rolled down her cheeks as
she continued: “We are alone now, for the last time it
may be, and I want to say to you what has been in my
heart to say, and what I must say before I die. When I
was up in that dreary back room in New York, so sick,
and forlorn, and poor, and you came to me, bright, and
gay, and beautiful, I did not like it at all, and for a time
I felt hard toward you and angry at Theodore, who, I
knew, must see the difference between me,—faded, and
plain, and sickly, and old before my time, and you, the
woman he loved first,—fresh, and young, and full of life,
and health, and beauty. How you did seem to fill the
dingy room with brightness and beauty, and what a contrast
you were to me; and Theodore saw it, too, when he
came in and found you there. But if there was a regret
in his heart,—a sigh for what ought to have been, he
never let it appear, but after you were gone, and only
the delicate perfume of your garments lingered in the
room, he came and sat by me and held my thin, hard
hands, so unlike your soft white ones, and tried by his
manner to make me believe he was <em>not</em> sorry, and when
I could stand it no longer, and said to him: ‘I am not
much like her, Theo, am I?’ he guessed what was in my
mind, and answered me so cheerily, ‘No, Mollie, not
a bit like her. And how can you be, when your lives
have been so different; hers all sunshine, and yours full
of care, and toil, and pain. But you have borne it
bravely, Mollie; better, I think, than Bee would have
done.’ He called you Bee to me for the first time, and
there was something in his voice, as he spoke the name,
which told me how dear you had been to him once, if,
indeed, you were not then. But he was so good, and
kind, and tender toward me that I felt the jealousy
giving way, though there was a little hardness left
toward you, and that night after Theo was sleeping
beside me I prayed and prayed that God would take it
away, and He did, and I came at last to know you as you
are, the dearest, noblest, most unselfish woman the world
ever saw.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, no, you must not say that. I am not good or
unselfish; you don’t know me,” Bee cried, thinking remorsefully
of the times when she had ridiculed the brown
alpaca dress and the woman who wore it, and how often
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>she had tired of her society, in which she really found no
pleasure, such as she might have found elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c011'>But she could not wound her by telling her this.
She could only protest that she was not all Mrs. Morton
believed her to be. But Mollie would not listen.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You must be good,” she said, “or you would never
have left your beautiful home and your friends and
attached yourself to me, who am only a drag upon you.
But sometime in the future you will be rewarded; and,
forgive me, Miss Belknap, if I speak out plain, now, like
one who stands close down to the river of death, and,
looking back, can see what probably will be. I do not
know how you feel toward Theo, but of this I am sure,
he has never taken another into the place you once filled,
and at a suitable time after I am gone he will repeat the
words he said to you years ago, and if he does, don’t
send him away a second time. He is nearer to your
standard now than he was then. He is growing all the
time in the estimation of his fellow-men. They are
going to make him a D. D., and the parish of which he
is pastor is one of the best and most highly cultivated in
Boston. And you will go there, I hope, and be a mother
to my children, and bring them up like you, for that will
please Theo better than my homely ways. Trix is like
you now, and Bunchie will learn, though she is slower to
imitate. You will be happy with Theo,—and I am glad for
him and the children; but you will not let them forget
me quite, but will tell them sometimes of their mother,
who loved them so much. I hoped to see Theo once
more before I died, but something tells me he will not
be here in time; that when he comes I shall be dead.
So you will ask him to forget the many times I worried
and fretted him with my petty cares and troubles. Tell
him that Mollie puts her arms around his neck and lays
her poor head, which will never ache again, against his
good, kind heart, and so bids him good-by, and goes
away alone into the brightness beyond, for it is all bright
and peaceful; and just over the river I am crossing I
seem to see the distant towers of ‘Jerusalem the Golden’
gleaming in the heavenly sunshine, which lies so warm
upon the everlasting hills. And my babies are there waiting
and watching for me. Sing, can’t you, ‘Will some one
be at the beautiful gate, waiting and watching for me?’”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>There was too heavy a sorrow in Beatrice’s heart,
and her voice was too full of tears for her to sing to
the dying woman, who clung so closely to her. But
what <em>she</em> could not do, little Trixey did for her. She
had entered the room unobserved, followed by Bunchie,
whose hands were full of the sweet wild-flowers they
had gathered and brought to their mother, who was
past caring for such things now. The yellow jessamine
and wild honeysuckle lay unheeded upon her pillow,
but at the sound of her children’s voices a spasm of
intense pain passed for a moment over her face, and was
succeeded by a smile of peace as she whispered again:
“Somebody sing of the beautiful gate,” and instantly
Trixey’s clear voice rang through the room, mingled
with little Bunchie’s lisping, broken notes, as she, too,
struck in and sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Will any one be at the beautiful gate,</div>
      <div class='line'>Waiting and watching for me?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Dear little ones, they did not know their mother was
dying; but Beatrice did, and her tears fell like rain upon
the pinched, white face pillowed on her arm, as she
kissed the quivering lips, which whispered softly:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Darling Trix and Bunchie,—God bless them!—and
tell Theo Mollie will be at the beautiful gate, waiting
and watching for him, and for you all,—waiting and
watching as they now wait and watch for me over there,
the shining ones, crowding on the shore, and some are
there to whom I first told the story of Jesus in the far-off
heathen land. Tell Theo they are there, and many whom
he led to the Saviour. It is no delusion, as some have
thought. I see them, I see into Heaven, and it is so
near; it lies right side by side with this world, only a
step between.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Her mind was wandering a little, for her words
became indistinct, until her voice ceased altogether, and
Beatrice watched her as the last great struggle went on
and the soul parted from the body, which was occasionally
convulsed with pain, as if it were hard to sever the
tie which bound together the mortal and immortal.</p>

<p class='c011'>At last, just as the beautiful southern sunset flooded
the river and the fields beyond with golden and rosy
hues, and the fresh evening breeze came stealing into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>room, laden with the perfume of the orange and lemon
blossoms it had kissed on its way, Mollie Morton passed
from the world where she had known so much care to
the life immortal, where the shining ones were waiting
and watching for her.</p>

<p class='c011'>And far down the coast, threading in and out among
the little islands and streams, came the boat which bore
the Rev. Theodore Morton to the wife he hoped to find
alive. Bee’s summons had found him busy with his
people, with whom he was deservedly popular, and who
bade him God-speed, and followed him with prayers for
his own safety, and, if possible, the recovery of his wife,
whom they had never seen. But this last was not to be,
and when about noon the boat came up to its accustomed
landing-place, and Bee stood on the wharf to meet him,
he knew by one glance at her face that he had come too
late. Everything which love could devise was done for
the dead, on whose white face the husband’s tears fell
fast when he first looked upon it, feeling, it may be, an
inner consciousness of remorse as he remembered that
all his heart had not been given to her. But he had
been kind, and tender, and considerate, and he folded her
children in his arms, and felt that in all the world there
was nothing so dear to him as his motherless little ones.</p>

<p class='c011'>The next day they left Florida for the bleak hills of
Vermont, where the wintry winds and drifting snow
seemed to howl a wild requiem for the dead woman,
whose body rested one night in the old home where the
white-haired father and mother wept so piteously over
it, and even Aunt Nancy forgot to care for the tracks
upon her clean kitchen floor, as the villagers came in
with words of condolence and sympathy. Beatrice was
with the mourners who stood by the grave that wild
January day when Mollie Morton was buried, and she
gave the message from the dead to the husband, who
wept like a child when he saw his wife laid away under
the blinding snow, which, ere the close of the day, covered
the grave in one great mountain drift.</p>

<p class='c011'>Both Everard and Rossie had written to Beatrice
telling her of Josephine’s arrival at the Forrest House,
and, with a feeling that she was needed in Rothsay, she
started for home the day after Mollie’s funeral.</p>

Josephine had resolved to be popular at any
cost, and make for herself a party, and so
good use had she made of her time and opportunities
that when Beatrice arrived the
weaker ones, who, with Mrs. Rider at their
head, had from the first espoused her cause, were gradually
gaining in numbers; while the better class of people,
Everard’s friends, were beginning to think more kindly
of the lady of the Forrest House, where an entire new
state of things and code of laws had been inaugurated.
Axie had, of course, vacated immediately after Rossie’s
departure, and Josephine had been wise enough not to
ask her to remain. She knew the old negress was
strongly prejudiced against her, and was glad when she
departed, bag and bundle, for the little house she had
purchased in town, where she could be near “her boy,”
and wash and mend his clothes, and fight for him when
necessary, as it sometimes was, for people could not
easily understand his indifference to the beautiful creature
who was conducting herself so sweetly and modestly,
and whom women ran to the windows to see
when she drove by in the pretty phaeton which, through
Rossie’s influence, she had managed to get from Everard,
or rather, from the Forrest estate. It is true the horse
did not suit her. It was too old and slow, and not at all
like the spirited animal she used to drive with Captain
Sparks at her side in Holburton, but it was an <em>heir-loom</em>,
as she called it, laughingly, raised from a stock of horses
which had been in the family for years, and was so
steady that Mr. Forrest was perfectly willing to trust
her with it; and each day she drove around the town,
showing herself everywhere, bowing to everybody high
and low, and because she had heard that Miss Belknap
used to do so, taking to drive the sick and infirm among
the poor and needy, to whom she was all kindness and
sympathy. With this class, however, she did not stand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>as well as with the grade above them. It would almost
seem as if they were gifted with a special insight, and
read her character aright; and though they accepted
what she offered them, they did not believe in her, and
privately among themselves declared she was not a lady
born,—or a fitting wife for Everard.</p>

<p class='c011'>Agnes never appeared with her in public, and was
seldom seen at the house when people called. “She was
very shy and timid, and shrank from meeting strangers,”
Josephine said, to the few who felt that they must ask
for her, and who accepted the excuse and left Agnes
free to become in Rothsay what she had been in Holburton,
a mere household drudge, literally doing all the
work for the colored woman whom Josephine employed
and called her cook, but who was wholly incompetent as
well as indisposed to work. So the whole care devolved
on Agnes, who took up her burden without a word of
protest, and worked from morning till night, while Josephine
lounged in her own room, where she had her meals
more than half the time, or drove through the town in
her phaeton, managing always to pass the office where
Everard toiled early and late, in order that he might
have the means to support her without touching a dollar
of Rossie’s fortune.</p>

<p class='c011'>As yet Josephine’s demands upon him were not very
great. Old Axie had been a provident housekeeper, and
Josephine found a profusion of everything necessary for
the table. Her wardrobe did not need replenishing, and
she could not venture upon inviting company so soon,
consequently she was rather moderate in her demands
for money; but Everard knew the time would come when
all he had would scarcely satisfy her, and for that time
he worked, silently, doggedly, rarely speaking to any one
outside his business unless they spoke to him, and never
offering a word of explanation with regard to the
estrangement, which was becoming more and more a
matter of wonder and comment,—as people saw only
sweetness and graciousness in Josey, and knew nothing
of her other side.</p>

<p class='c011'>Such was the state of affairs when Beatrice came
home, very unexpectedly to the Rothsayites, who wondered
what she would think of matters at the Forrest
House. Josephine had spoken frequently of Miss Belknap,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>who, she said, was for a few weeks an inmate of her
mother’s family, and whom she admired greatly. Josey
was the first to call upon Beatrice; and throwing herself
upon her neck, burst into tears, saying:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Miss Belknap, I am so glad you have come to
be my friend and sister, and I need one so much. I
wish I had told you the truth when you were in Holburton,
but Everard was afraid of having it known, and
now he is so cold and distant and I,—am,—so unhappy.
You will be my friend and help me. You were always
so kind to me, and I liked you so much.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Beatrice shook her off as gently as possible, and
answered that she should certainly try to do right,
and asked after Agnes, and how her visitor liked Rothsay,
and if Rosamond had written to her, and gradually
drew the conversation away from dangerous ground,
and did it in such a manner that Josephine felt that she
had more to fear from Bee Belknap than from all the
world besides. And she had, for Bee’s opinion was
worth more than that of any twenty people in Rothsay;
and when it was known that there was little or no
intercourse between Elm Park and the Forrest House,
that the two ladies were polite to each other and nothing
more, that Beatrice never expressed herself with
regard to Mrs. Forrest or mentioned her in any way,
but was on the same friendly terms with Everard as ever,
and when, as a crowning act, she made a little dinner
party from which Josephine was omitted, the people
who had been loudest in Josey’s praises began to whisper
together that there must be something wrong, and gradually
a cloud not larger than a man’s hand began to
show itself on the horizon. But small as it was, Josephine
discovered its rising, and fought it with all her
power, even going so far as to insinuate that jealousy
and disappointment were the causes of Miss Belknap’s
coolness toward her. But this fell powerless and dead,
and Josey could no more injure Beatrice than she could
turn the channel of the river from its natural course.
For a time, however, Josephine held her ground with a
few, but when early in June the new hotel on the river
road was filled with people from the South, many of
them gay, reckless young men, ready for any excitement,
she began to show her real nature, and her assumed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>modesty and reticence slipped from her like a garment
unfitted to the wearer. How she managed it no one
could guess, but in less than two weeks she knew every
young man stopping at the Belknap House, as it was
named in honor of Beatrice, and in less than three weeks
she had taken them all to drive with her, and Forrest
House was no longer lonely for want of company, for
the doors stood open till midnight, and young men
lounged on the steps and in the parlors, and came to
lunch and dinner, and the rooms were filled with cigar-smoke,
and Bacchanalian songs were sung by the half-tipsy
young men, and toasts were drank to their fair
hostess, whom they dubbed “Golden Hair,” and called
an angel to her face, and at her back, among themselves,
a <em>brick</em>, and even “the old girl,” so little did they respect
or really care for her.</p>

<p class='c011'>And Josephine was quite happy again, and content.
It suited her better to be fast than to play the part of a
quiet, discreet woman, and so long as she did not overstep
the bounds of decency, or greatly outrage the rules
of propriety, she argued that it was no one’s business
what she did or how much attention she received. As
Axie had predicted, the real color was showing through
the whitewash, and people began to understand the reason
why Everard was becoming so grave, and reserved, and
even old in his appearance, with a look upon his face
such as no ordinary trouble could ever have written
there.</p>

<p class='c011'>And so the summer waned and autumn came and
went, and then Josephine, who, while affecting to be so
merry and gay, writhed under the slights so often put upon
her, discovered that she needed a change of air, and decided
that a winter in Florida was necessary to her
health and happiness, and applied to Everard for the
means with which to carry out her plan. At first
Everard objected to the Florida trip as something much
more expensive than he felt able to meet, but his consent
was finally given, and one morning in December the
clerk at the St. James Hotel, in Jacksonville, wrote upon
his books “Mrs. J. E. Forrest and maid, and Miss Agnes
Fleming, Rothsay, Ohio,” while a week later there
was entered upon another page, “Dr. John Matthewson,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>New York City,” and two weeks later still “Mrs. Andrews
and family, and Miss Rosamond Hastings, St.
Louis, Mo.”</p>

<div class='c010'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/di_292.jpg' width='100' alt=''>
</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
The St. James was full that season, and when
Mrs. J. E. Forrest arrived she found every
room occupied, and was compelled to take
lodgings at a house across the Park, where
guests from the hotel were sometimes accommodated
with rooms, and where, in addition to her own
parlor and bedroom, she found a large square chamber,
which she asked the mistress of the house to reserve for
a few days, as she was expecting an old friend of her
husband’s, and would like to have him near her, inasmuch
as Mr. Forrest was not able to come with her on account
of his business. Later in the season he might join her,
but now he was too busy. She laid great stress upon
having a husband, and she was so gracious, and affable,
and pretty, that her landlady, Mrs. Morris, was charmed
at once, and indorsed the beautiful woman who attracted
so much attention in the street, and who at the
hotel took everything by storm. She had laid aside her
mourning, and blossomed out in a most exquisite suit of
navy-blue silk and velvet, which, although made in Paris
more than a year before, was still a little in advance of
the Florida fashions, and was admired by every lady in
the hotel, and patterns of the pocket, and cuffs, and overskirt
were mentally taken and experimented upon in the
ladies’ rooms, where the grace, and beauty, and probable
antecedents of the stranger were freely discussed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nobody had ever heard of Mrs. J. E. Forrest, and few
had heard of Rothsay, but there were some people at the St.
James, this winter, who remembered Miss Belknap and
Mrs. Morton, and when it was known that Mrs. Forrest
was their friend the matter was settled, and Josephine
became the belle and beauty of the place. Young men
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>stationed themselves near the door through which she
came in to the hall to look at her as she passed, but if she
was conscious of their homage she made no sign, and
never seemed to know how much attention she was attracting.
One or two ladies spoke to her at last as she
stopped for a while in the parlor, and so her acquaintance
began, and Miss Belknap was brought to the surface, and
Mr. Forrest was talked about, and a little hacking cough
was produced, by way of showing what had sent this
dainty, delicate creature away from her husband, with
no other guardianship than that of her sister. But
Agnes’ presence was sufficient to save appearances. She
was much older, and so quiet and reserved, and even
shy, that the ladies made no advances to her, and after a
little scarcely noticed her as she sat apart from them,
waiting patiently till her brilliant sister was ready to go
home. Josephine was expecting a gentleman friend,
whom she had known ever since she was a young girl,
she said, the fourth day after her arrival, and the ladies
were glad, as it would be so much pleasanter for her in
her husband’s absence; and so matters were made easy
for the coming of Dr. Matthewson, who, since parting
from Josephine in Dresden, more than a year before, had
visited nearly every city of note in Europe, sometimes
meeting with success in his profession as gambler and
sometimes not, sometimes living like a millionaire and
sometimes like a beggar. The millionaire life suited him
the best, but how to secure it as a permanency, or even
to secure a comfortable living which required neither
exertion nor self-denial, was something which puzzled
him sorely, until he received a letter from Josephine,
which inspired him at once with fresh courage and hope.
The letter, which was written from the Forrest House,
was a long time in reaching him, and found him at last
in Moscow, where his genius of bad luck was in the
ascendant, and he had fallen into the toils of a set of
sharpers, who were using him for their own base purposes.
Handsome in face and form, winning in his manner,
and perfectly familiar with nearly every language
spoken on the Continent, he was very useful to them by
way of bringing under their influence strangers who
visited the city, and they kept a hold upon him which he
could not well shake off.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>When he received Josephine’s letter telling him
where she was, and the disposition Judge Forrest had
made of his property, and Rosamond’s determination
not to use more of it than was absolutely necessary, but
to restore it to Everard when she came of age, he made
up his mind to leave Moscow at all hazards, and, crossing
the sea, seek out the sister in whom he suddenly
found himself greatly interested. And to this end fortune
favored him at last by sending in his way a German
Jew,—Van Schoisner,—between whom and himself there
sprang up a friendship which finally resulted in the Jew’s
loaning him money enough to escape from the city which
had been in one sense a prison to him. Van Schoisner
was his <i><span lang="fr">compagnon-du-voyage</span></i>, and as both were gamblers,
they made straight for Vienna, where Matthewson’s
luck came back to him, and he won so rapidly and
largely that Van Schoisner, who was tinged with German
superstition, regarded him as one whom the god of the
gaming-table especially favored, and clung to him and
made much of him, and when a malarial fever attacked
him took him to his brother’s, a Dr. Van Schoisner, who
kept what he called a private <i><span lang="fr">maison de sante</span></i>, in an
obscure Austrian town, half-way between Vienna and
Lintz.</p>

<p class='c011'>And here Dr. Matthewson paid the penalty of his
dissipated life in a fit of sickness which lasted for
months, and left him weak and feeble as a child. During
all this time he did not hear from Josephine, whose
letters never reached him, and he knew nothing of her
until he reached New York, when he wrote at once to
her at Rothsay, asking very particularly for Rosamond,
and announcing his intention of visiting the Forrest
House, if agreeable to the inmates.</p>

<p class='c011'>To this letter Josephine replied immediately, telling
him not on any account to come to Rothsay, but to join
her in Florida about the middle of December, when she
would tell him everything which had happened to her
since their last meeting in Dresden. In a postscript she
added:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Miss Hastings is not here, and has not been since
last January. She is somebody’s governess, I believe.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And it was this postscript which interested the doctor
more than the whole of Josephine’s letter. If Rosamond
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>were not in Rothsay, then where was she, and how should
he find her? for find her he must, and play the role of
the loving brother, which role would be all the more
effective, he thought, because of the air of invalidism
there was about him now, and which sat well upon him.
He really was weak from his recent illness, but he
affected more languor than he felt, and seemed quite
tired and exhausted when he reached the house where
Josephine was stopping, and where his room was in readiness
for him; and Josephine cooed and fluttered about
him, and was glad to see him, and so anxious that he
should have every possible attention.</p>

<p class='c011'>And Dr. Matthewson enjoyed it all to the full, and
was never tired of hearing of the Forrest House, or of
asking questions about Rosamond, of whom Josey at last
affected to be jealous.</p>

<p class='c011'>And so the days went on until the first week in January,
when one morning, as the doctor and Josephine sat
together on the long piazza of the hotel, a carriage from
the boat arrived, laden with trunks, and children, and
two ladies, one middle-aged, and apparently the mother
of the children, the other, young, graceful, and pretty,
even in her soiled traveling dress of dark gray serge.
As she threw back her vail and descended from the carriage
Josephine started suddenly, and exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Rosamond Hastings, for all the world! What
brought her here?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who? Where? Do you mean that girl with the
blue vail and gray dress, and,—by Jove, those magnificent
eyes?” Dr. Matthewson said, as Rosamond turned
her face in the direction where he was sitting, and
glanced rapidly at the groups of people upon the piazza,
without, however, seeing any one distinctly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, that’s Rosamond,” Josey replied, with a feeling
of annoyance at the arrival of one who might work her
so much harm. “I’ll see her at once, and make that matter
right,” she thought, and trusting to Rossie’s good
nature and her ingenuity, she resumed her conversation
with the doctor, who seemed unusually silent and absent-minded,
and after a little excused himself, saying he was
not feeling quite well, and believed he’d take a sail on
the river, and see if the fresh air would not revive him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Usually Josephine had been his companion in his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>sails on the river, but he did not ask her to go with him
now. He preferred to be alone, and with a gracious
bow he walked away, not so much to try the river air as
to think over and perfect his plans for the future.</p>

<p class='c011'>“By George!” he said to himself, “this is what I
call luck. Here I’ve been wondering how I should find
the girl, and behold, she has dropped suddenly upon me,
and if I play my cards well the game is mine, and her
money too, or my name is not Matthewson, <i><span lang="fr">ne</span></i>  Hastings,
<i><span lang="fr">ne</span></i>  villain of the first water.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XLI.<br> <span class='large'>HOW THE GAME WAS PLAYED.</span></h2>
</div>

<div class='c010'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/di_296.jpg' width='100' alt=''>
</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
Rosamond’s life as a governess had been a
very happy one, but still there was always
present with her a consciousness of pain
and loss,—a keen regret and intense longing
for the “might have been,” and a great pity
for Everard, whose lot she knew was so much harder to
bear than her own; for with him the burden was growing
heavier, and the chain ever lengthening, which bound
him to his fate. He had written to her frequently during
the past year, friendly, brotherly letters, such as Josephine
might have read without just cause of complaint.
But he had given way once, and in a moment when his
sky was very dark, had poured out his soul in passionate,
burning words, telling how dreary life was to him without
her, and asking if she could not bring herself to
think that the divorce he could so easily get was valid,
and would free him from the hateful tie which bound
him?</p>

<p class='c011'>And Rosamond had answered him, “Only God can
free you from the bond,” and had said he must never
write like that to her again if he wished her to answer
him; and so the last hope was crushed, and Everard took
up his load once more and tried to bear it more manfully,
and by a closer attention to his practice to forget the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>bliss which might have been his had he not rashly thrown
the chance away. Rossie had said to him in her letter,
“Pray, Everard, as I do; pray often, that you may
learn to think of me as only your sister, the little Rossie
who amused you and whom you liked to tease.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But Everard did not pray. On the contrary, he was
in a most resentful and rebellious frame of mind, and
blamed the Providence which had permitted him to go
so far astray. It was well enough for women to pray,
and those who had never been tried and tempted as he
had been, but for himself, he saw no justice in God’s
dealings with him, and he could not ask to be content
with what he loathed from his very soul, he wrote in
reply to Rossie, who, while he grew harder and more
reckless, was rapidly developing into a character sweeter
and lovelier than anything Everard had known. And
the new life and principle within her showed itself
upon her face, which was like the face of Murillo’s
sweetest Madonna, where the earthly love blends so harmoniously
with the divine, and gives a glorious and
saintly expression to the lovely countenance. But Rossie’s
health had suffered from this constant sense of pain
and loss. The bright color was gone from her cheeks
save as it came and went with fatigue or excitement,
and there was about her a frail, delicate look, wholly
unlike the child Rossie, who used to be so full of life
and vigor in the old happy days at the Forrest House.
Still, she complained of nothing except that she was
always tired, but this was, in Mrs. Andrews’ mind, a sufficiently
alarming symptom, and it was as much on Rossie’s
account as on her own that she planned the trip to
Florida, where she hoped the warm sunlight would
bring strength again to the girl whom she loved almost
as a daughter.</p>

<p class='c011'>And so they were at the St. James, where Mrs. Andrews
found several acquaintances, but Rossie saw no
one whom she knew, and as she had a severe headache
she kept her room, and did not appear until the second
day, when she dressed herself and went down to join
Mrs. Andrews on the piazza, where the guests usually
congregated in the morning. There was a crowd of them
there now, and Mrs. Andrews, who was very popular and
entertaining, was already the center of a group of friends,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>with whom she was talking, when Rosamond appeared,
and made her way towards her. Everybody turned
to look after her, and none more eagerly than Dr. Matthewson,
who stood leaning against the railing, and
waiting for Josephine to join him. He had watched
for Rossie all the preceding day, after her arrival, and
felt greatly disappointed at her non-appearance, but he
knew she was there, his half-sister, and the heiress to
hundreds of thousands, and, as he believed, of a nature
which he could mold as he would clay, if he could only
know just what her tastes were, and adapt himself to
them. As yet he had been quite non-committal, only
devoting himself to Josephine, and talking very little
with any one, so that he could, if necessary, become a
saint or a sinner, and not seem inconsistent. Probably
he would have to be a saint, he thought; and when at
last Rossie appeared, and passed so near to him that he
might have touched her, he was quite sure of it. Girls
with the expression in their faces which hers wore didn’t
believe in slang and profanity, and the many vices to
which he was addicted, and of which Josephine made so
light. Rossie was pure and innocent, and must never
suspect the black catalogue of sins at which he sometimes
dared not look. How fair and lovely she was, with
that sweet modesty of demeanor which never could
have been feigned for the occasion; and how eagerly
the doctor watched her as she joined Mrs. Andrews, and
was introduced to the ladies around her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good morning. A penny for your thoughts,” was
cooed in his ear, and turning, he met Josephine’s blue
eyes uplifted to him, and Josephine herself stood there
in her very prettiest white wrapper, with an oleander
blossom in her golden hair.</p>

<p class='c011'>She, too, had watched anxiously for Rosamond,
whom she meant to secure before any mischief could
be done, and she saw her now at once in the distance,
and saw the doctor was looking in that direction, too,
and knew, before she asked him, of what he was thinking.
But a slight frown darkened her face at his frank
reply:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am thinking how very pretty and attractive Miss
Hastings is. You must manage to introduce me as soon
as possible, or I shall introduce myself.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>Just then Rossie turned her face fully toward her,
and their eyes met in recognition. There was a violent
start on Rossie’s part, and the blood flamed into her
cheeks for an instant and then left them ashy pale, as
she saw the woman for whom she could not have much
respect smiling so brightly upon her, and advancing to
meet her as quickly and gladly as if they were the greatest
friends.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Miss Hastings!” she said, in her most flute-like
tones, “this is a surprise. I am so glad to see you.
When did you come?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Rossie explained when she had come and with whom,
and after a few brief remarks on the town and the climate,
made as if she would return to Mrs. Andrews; but
now was Josephine’s opportunity or never, and still
holding Rossie’s hand, which she had not relinquished,
she said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come with me a moment, please; there are so many
things I want to say. Suppose we take a little turn on
the piazza,” and leading Rossie around the corner of the
hotel to a seat where no one was sitting, she plunged at
once into the subject uppermost in her mind.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Miss Hastings,” she said, “you alone of all the
people here know just how I am living with Everard, or,
rather, not living with him. It was not necessary for
me to explain everything, and for aught they know to
the contrary, I have the most devoted of husbands, who
may join me any day. You, of course, can undeceive
them if you like, but——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mrs. Forrest,” Rossie exclaimed, “I have no wish
to injure you. If I am asked straightforward questions
I must tell the truth; otherwise I have nothing to say of
your life at home, or of anything in the past pertaining
to you and Everard.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you so much. I knew I could trust you,”
Josephine said, feeling immensely relieved. “And now
come, let me present you to a friend whom I used to
know in Holburton, and met afterward in Dresden. He
is here for his health, and is so kind to Aggie and me.
You must come to my room and see Agnes. She never
stops a moment here after she has had her meals.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She talked rapidly and excitedly, and laid her hand on
Rossie’s arm, as if to lead her to Dr. Matthewson, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>forestalled the intention by suddenly appearing before
them. He was more impatient to speak to Rosamond
than Josephine was to have him, and joined them for
that very purpose. Never in his life had he seemed
more at his ease or appeared to better advantage, and
there was something very winning and gracious in his
manner as he bowed to Miss Hastings, and hoped she
found herself well in the delicious Florida air.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You do not look very strong,” he said. “I hope a
few days of this sunshine will do you much good.” He
was very kind and considerate, and bade her be seated
again while he talked with her a few moments on indifferent
topics. Then, consulting his watch, he said to
Josephine: “Mrs. Forrest, don’t you think we should
have that game of croquet before the day gets hotter?
You see they are beginning to occupy the grounds already,”
and he nodded toward the opposite side of the
park, where a group of young ladies and gentlemen were
knocking about the balls preparatory to a game. “To-morrow
we shall ask you to join us,” he said to Rossie,
“but as a physician, I advise you to rest to-day after your
long journey. Coming suddenly into this climate is apt
to debilitate if one is not careful. Good morning, Miss
Hastings,” and with a graceful wave of his hand he
walked away with Josephine, leaving Rosamond to look
after and admire his splendid physique and manly form,
and to think what a pleasant, gentlemanly person he was,
with such a melodious voice.</p>

<p class='c011'>Already he was beginning to affect and influence her
thoughts, and she sat and watched him as he walked
very slowly toward the croquet-ground, where, instead
of joining in the game, he sat down at some little distance
and continued his conversation with Josephine,
whose cheeks were flushed and who seemed unusually
excited.</p>

<p class='c011'>The doctor’s first remark to her as they left the hotel
had been:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, Joe, did you fix it all right with her?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Fix what?” Josephine asked, knowing perfectly
well what he meant, but being determined that he should
explain.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, have you hired her not to go back on you,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>and tell that you are a grass widow instead of a loving
wife, whose husband is pining in her absence?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The elegant doctor could be very coarse and unfeeling
when he talked with Josephine, whom he understood
so well, and who replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you mean will she hold her tongue about my
affairs, she will, and she does not know that you are the
‘priest all shaven and shorn, who married the youth all
tattered and torn to the maiden all forlorn.’ I did not
think it necessary to tell her that. Possibly, though, she
may have heard your name from Everard; I do not
know how that may be. I only told her that I knew
you in Holburton, and that I met you again in Dresden.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes;”—the doctor smoothed his mustache thoughtfully
a moment, and then added: “I say, Joe, don’t be
in such a hurry to get to the croquet. I want to talk
with you. I’ve turned a new leaf. I’ve reformed.
That time I was so sick in Austria, I repented. I did,
upon my soul, and said a bit of a prayer,—and I believe
I’ll join the church again; but first I’ll confess to you,
who I know will be as lenient toward me as any one.
I suppose you think you know just what and who I am,
but you are mistaken. I am a hypocrite, a rascal, a
gambler, and have broken every Commandment, I do
believe, except ‘thou shalt not kill,’ and under great
provocation I might do that, perhaps; and, added to all
this, I am Rossie Hastings’ half-brother.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Rossie Hastings’ brother! Do you mean you are
Rosamond’s brother? and did you know it when you
first came to Holburton, and why isn’t your name Hastings,
then?” Josephine asked, excitedly, and he replied,
in the most quiet and composed manner:</p>

<p class='c011'>“One question at a time, my dear. I <em>am</em> her brother,
and my name was Hastings once,—John Matthewson
Hastings. I took the Matthewson and dropped the
Hastings to please a relative, who left me a few thousands
at her death. I <em>did</em> know Rossie was my sister
when I first met Everard Forrest in Holburton, and to
that knowledge you owe your present exalted position as
his wife.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She turned her eyes inquiringly upon him, and he
continued:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>“I told you I was going to make a clean breast of
my sins, and I am, so far as your business is concerned.
I hated Everard and the whole Forrest race, and <em>that</em> was
my revenge!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hated Everard! For what? Had you seen him
before you met him in Holburton?” Josephine said; and
he replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I had seen him, and I carried the marks of our
meeting for weeks and weeks on my forehead, and the
remembrance of it in my heart always. I had a stepmother,—a
weak young thing whom I hated from the
first, for no special reason that I now recall, except that
she was a stepmother and I thought I <em>must</em> hate her;
and I did, and worried her life almost out of her; and
when a baby sister was born I hated that, because it was
hers, and because it would naturally share in my father’s
property, which was not large. The new mother was
luxurious in her tastes, and spent a great deal, and that
made trouble between her and my father, who, though a
very elegant man in public, was the very Old Nick at
home, and led his young wife such a life that even I
pitied her sometimes, and did not wonder that she left him
at last, and took refuge with her intimate friend, Mrs.
Forrest, Everard’s mother. Not long after she left
home my father died, and I was made very angry because
of some money he left to Rossie, which I thought
ought to be mine, inasmuch as it came to him from my
mother. So I persecuted my mother-in-law, who, I
believe, was more afraid of me than of the old Harry
himself. I went to the Forrest House and demanded
first to see her, and then to see my sister, pretending I
was going to take her away. The boy Everard was at
home, had just come in from riding, and he ordered me
from the house, and when I refused to go the stripling
attacked me with his whip, and laid the blows on well,
too, especially the one on my face, the mark of which I
carried so long. I swore I’d have revenge on him, and I
kept my word, though at one time I gave up the idea
entirely. That was at the camp-meeting, where a lot of
them converted me, or thought they did, and for a spell
I felt differently, and got a license to preach, and tried to
be good; but the seed was sown on stony ground and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>came to nothing, and I took seven spirits worse than the
first, and backslid and quit the ministry, and went to
studying physic, and was called doctor, and roamed the
world over, sometimes with plenty of money, sometimes
with none, and drifted at last to Holburton, where you
asked me to be the priest in the play, and marry you to
Everard Forrest. You probably do not remember how
closely I questioned you about the young man. I wished
to be certain with regard to his identity, and I was after
talking with him about his home in Rothsay. He told
me of Rossie, and boasted of the whipping he had given
her brother, whose vengeance he did not fear. He was
young. His father was rich, and proud as Lucifer, and
would hardly think a princess good enough to marry his
only son, much less you, the daughter of his landlady.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Something told me I could not do Everard a worse
turn than to tie him fast in matrimony. You were not
his stamp; not the one to hold him long; he would repent
the act sooner or later, while his father would make
life a burden to him when he came to know it. So I
was particular to leave nothing undone which would
make the marriage valid, and when you were man and
wife I felt perfectly happy, until,—I began to get interested
in you myself, and then I sometimes wished my
tongue had been cut out, for I’ll be hanged if I don’t
admire you more than any woman I ever saw, notwithstanding
that I know you like a book.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Spare your compliments and keep to your story,
and tell me why you have made no effort to see Rossie
all these years,” Josephine said, coldly; and he replied,
“Reason enough. I was not particularly interested in
her then, and did not think an acquaintance with her
would pay; but later she has come before me in the
character of an heiress, which makes her a very different
creature; you see, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I see. Your sudden interest in her is wholly
mercenary. Suppose I should betray you? Are you
not afraid of it?” Josephine asked, and in her blue
eyes there was a look which the doctor did not quite
like; but he affected not to see it, and replied, “Afraid?
No, because telling is a game two can play at as well
as one. You cannot afford to quarrel with me, Joe.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>The man’s face was exceedingly insolent and disagreeable
in its expression for a moment, while he
glanced sidewise at his companion, who made no sign
that she heard him, but seemed wholly intent upon the
game, which was now growing very exciting. But when
the expression changed, and he continued in his most
winning tone:</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, we must stick to each other, and whatever good
comes to me I’ll share religiously with you;” she began
faintly to comprehend him, and turning her eyes upon
him, said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, to return to first principles, Rossie is interesting
to you now because she has money; but she will
not use it even for herself.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No!”—and the doctor mused thoughtfully a moment;
then he said: “I like the girl’s appearance, upon
my soul I do! She is a pretty little filly, and if I’d met
her years ago she might have made a man of me, but
it is too late now; I am sold to Satan, body and soul,
and must do his bidding. How much is she worth, do
you think?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The Forrest estate is variously estimated from two
hundred to five hundred thousand. I should say, perhaps,
two hundred and fifty,” Josephine replied, and the
doctor continued:</p>

<p class='c011'>“And she will not touch the principal on account of
some queer notions she has of giving it back to Forrest
when she is twenty-one?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, she will not touch the principal, nor more of
the interest than is absolutely necessary,” Josephine said,
and for a few moments the doctor was silent and seemed
to be intently thinking.</p>

<p class='c011'>When he spoke again he said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“You say she is pious, or pretends to be, and if she
does it is genuine; there is no deceit in that face. I’d
trust it with my soul, if necessary. I tell you I like the
girl. She is just the one to keep men from losing faith
in everything good. I’ll wager now that Forrest is in
love with her, and that’s one reason he does not take any
more stock in you. Is he?” and the doctor looked
steadily at Josephine, who turned very pale as he thus
probed her so closely.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>So far as affection was concerned she had none for
her husband, but it hurt her pride cruelly to know that
with all her beauty and grace she could not influence
him one whit, or turn him from the girl she was sure he
loved as he had never loved her. She generally told the
truth to Dr. Matthewson, who had some subtle power to
find it out if she did not, and now, though sorely against
her will, she answered:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, he worships the ground she treads upon.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then, why in thunder doesn’t he get a divorce from
you and marry her? That surely would be an easy
thing to do under the circumstances,” was the doctor’s
next remark.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is more than I can guess, unless he is too proud
to endure the notoriety of such a procedure. Certainly
it is no consideration for me which deters him,” Josephine
said; adding suddenly, as she glanced up the street:
“There she comes now. You’d better declare yourself
at once.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But the doctor knew his own plans best with regard
to Rosamond, who was coming toward the croquet-ground
with two of her pupils, Clara and Eva Andrews.
She did not see the doctor and Josephine until she was
close upon them, and then simply bowing to them, she
passed on and was soon out of sight.</p>

<p class='c011'>That night, as she was about preparing for bed, a
thick heavy envelope was brought to her room, directed
in a hand she did not recognize. Breaking the seal and
glancing at the signature, she read with a thrill of wonder
and perplexity the name, “John Matthewson, <i><span lang="fr">ne</span></i>
Hastings,” while just above it were the words, “Your
affectionate brother.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My brother,” she repeated. “What does it mean?”
and for a moment she felt as if she were going to faint
with the rush of emotions which swept suddenly over
her.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of her brother, personally, she remembered nothing.
She only knew that she had one; that in some way he
annoyed and worried her mother; that he was not highly
esteemed by the Forrests, and that he was probably
dead. Latterly, however, since she had gone out into
the world alone to care for herself, she had often thought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>of him, and how delightful it would be to have a brother
who was good, and kind, and true, and who would care
for her as brothers sometimes care for their sisters. Occasionally,
too, she had amused herself with fancying
how he would look if he were alive, and how he would
treat her. But she had never dreamed of any one as
handsome, and polished, and elegant as Dr. Matthewson,
who signed himself her brother, and had filled three or
four sheets of paper with what he had to say. Very
eagerly she singled out the first sheet and began:</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Sister Rossie</span>:—You will pardon me for not
addressing you as Miss Hastings, or even Rosamond,
when I tell you I am your brother, and have always
thought of you as Rossie, the little girl who, I suppose,
does not remember me, and who, perhaps, has not been
taught to think of me very pleasantly. But, Rossie, I am
a changed man, or I would not present myself to you, a
pure, innocent girl, and ask for sympathy and love. I
do not believe you care to hear all the events of my life
in detail, and so I shall not narrate them, but of a few
things I must speak, in order that we may rightly understand
each other. And first, your mother. I was a
spoiled, wayward boy of sixteen when she came to us,
and I was prejudiced against her by an aunt of mine,
who, I think now, wanted my father herself. A stepmother
was to me the worst of all evils, and I thought it
was manly to tease and worry her, while I blush to say
my father also treated her so shamefully that at last she
fled from him, as you know, and took refuge at the Forrest
House, where she finally died.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I was there once to see her, and as you may not
have heard the particulars of that visit, and I wish to
keep back nothing you ought to know, I will tell you
about it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then followed a pretty truthful account of the encounter
with Everard, the cowhiding, and the vow of
revenge, after which the doctor spoke of his subsequent
career, his change of name, his sudden conversion at a
camp-meeting, his life as a clergyman in Clarence, his
back-sliding, and lapse into his former evil ways, his few
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>months’ study as a physician, his first trip to Europe,
and at last his sojourn for the summer in Holburton,
where he met Everard Forrest again, and was asked by
Josephine to take the part of priest in the play called
“Mock Marriage.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then it was,” he wrote, “that the devil entered into
me and whispered, ‘Now is your hour for revenge on the
stripling who dared lay his hand on you.’ From all I
could learn of the Forrests, or rather, of the judge, I
guessed that he would rebel hotly against a penniless
bride in Miss Fleming’s social position, and that nothing
could be more disastrous for Everard than such a marriage;
and yet I aided and abetted it, and took care that
it should be altogether binding, and so gained my mean
revenge, for which I have been sorry a thousand times,—yes,
more than that; and if I could undo the work of
that night I would do it gladly. But I cannot, and
others suffer the consequences. You see I am not ignorant
of the manner in which Mr. and Mrs. Forrest live,
and I am sorry for them both, and am laying bare my
heart to you that you may know exactly the kind of
brother you have found; and that, however bad he may
have been, he is a different man now, or he would never
intrude himself upon you.</p>

<p class='c013'>“On my first interview with Everard in Holburton,
I managed to get him to speak of you, and I half resolved
to seek you and claim you as my own. But a
sense of unworthiness kept me back. I was not a fitting
guardian for a girl like you, and so I still kept silence,
and after a time went to Europe again, where I remained
until quite recently, and where, by a long and dangerous
illness, I was brought to a realization of my sins, and
resolved to lead a new life. Naturally, one of the first
and strongest desires of my new life was to find you.
Mrs. Forrest, who wrote to me occasionally, had told
me that you had left the Forrest House, of which you
were the lawful heir; and as my health required a warm
climate, I came first to Florida, after my return to
America, intending, in the spring, to spare no pains to
find you. The rest you know.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And now, Rossie, will you take me for a brother?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>If so, please leave a line at the office, telling me where I
can see you and when, and in all the world there will be
no one so happy as your affectionate brother,</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>John Matthewson</span>, <i><span lang="fr">ne</span></i> <span class='sc'>Hastings</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Rossie was not as strong as when she was a child,
and any over-fatigue or unusual excitement was sure to
be followed by a nervous headache, which sometimes
lasted two or three days; and as she read this letter she
felt a cold, clammy sweat breaking out in the palms of
her hands, while a cutting pain in her head warned her
that her old enemy, neuralgia, was threatening an attack.
That she believed every word of the letter need hardly
be said, for hers was a nature to believe everything, and
it made her very happy to know that the brother who
heretofore had been to her only a myth, was found at
last, and <em>such</em> a brother, too. Then the question arose
as to how Everard would receive this man who had purposely
done him so great a wrong. Would he forgive
him for her sake, and believe in his repentance?
She should write to him the next day and tell him all
about it, and her heart throbbed with a new and keen
delight at the thought of some one to care for her, some
one to lean upon and advise her and help her with that
<em>dreadful Forrest estate</em>. And then her busy little brain
plunged into the future, and began to wonder where they
should live and how, for that she should live with her
brother she did not for a moment doubt. Her place was
with him, and she should try so hard to make him happy,
and keep him in the new way wherein he was beginning
to walk. In this state of mind it was impossible to
sleep, and when at last morning came it found her wakeful
and unrefreshed, with dark rings about her eyes, and
so severe a pain in her temples and the back of her neck
that to go down to breakfast was impossible. She had
barely strength to dress herself and lie down upon the
couch, where Mrs. Andrews found her, after having
waited some time for her appearance.</p>

<p class='c011'>Very rapidly and briefly Rosamond told her the good
news, which Mrs. Andrews accepted readily. She had
heard before that Miss Hastings had a brother, if he
were not dead, and having met the doctor the previous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>day and been much prepossessed with him, as strangers
always were, she rejoiced with her young friend, but
advised her to wait until her head was better before she
risked the excitement of an interview. But this Rossie
could not do. She should never be better till she had
seen her brother, she said, and a message was accordingly
sent him to the effect that Rossie would see him in
her room whenever he chose to come.</p>

<p class='c011'>The doctor did not wait a moment, and was soon at
Rossie’s side, bending over her, and telling her not to
allow herself to be agitated in the least, but to lie
quietly upon her pillow and let him do most of the talking.</p>

<p class='c011'>In all the world there was hardly a more accomplished
and fascinating hypocrite than Dr. Matthewson, and so
well did he use his powers and art that if Rossie had had any
distrust of him or his sincerity it would have been entirely
swept away during the half hour he spent with her, now
talking of himself as he used to be with great regret, and
of himself as he was now with great humility; now telling
how glad he was to find his little sister, and then
complimenting her in a way which could not fail to be
gratifying to any woman. Then he spoke of her health,
and was sorry to find her so frail and delicate, and
asked her many questions about herself, while he held
her hand and felt her pulse professionally. “Had she
ever thought her heart at all diseased, or that her lungs
were affected?” he asked; adding, quickly, as he saw the
sudden start she gave:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, don’t be frightened, and conclude you have
either consumption or heart disease. I only asked
because some members of our family far back died with
a heart difficulty, and if I remember right your mother
had consumption. But we must not let <em>you</em> have either
of them. You do not seem to have a great amount of
vitality. Are you never stronger than now, and do these
headaches occur very often?”</p>

<p class='c011'>He had her hand in one of his, and with the other
was stroking her head and hair, while she answered that
nothing ailed her except the headache to which she had
been subject all her life, and a predisposition to sore
throat whenever she took cold.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>“Ah, yes, I see,” and the doctor looked very wise.
“Bronchial trouble, no doubt, aggravated by our dreadful
American climate. Excuse me, <i><span lang="fr">mignonne</span></i>, if I confess
to being more than half a European. I have lived
abroad so much that I greatly prefer being there, and
know the climate is better for me. Some day not far
distant we must go there together, you and I, and I’ll
take such care of you that people will hardly know you
when you come back. I’ll have some color in these white
cheeks, though I don’t believe I could improve the eyes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was the great desire of Rossie’s life to go to
Europe some day, and she assented to all her brother
said, and wrote to Everard immediately after her interview
with the doctor, and told him of her brother, and
what a good, noble man he had become.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, as carefully and gently as possible, she spoke
of the wrong he had done to Everard, and for which he
was so very sorry.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do not suppose you can ever like him as I do,”
she wrote, “but I hope you will try to be friends with
him for my sake.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Accompanying this letter was one from the doctor himself,
couched in the most conciliatory terms, full of regret
for the past and strong in good intentions for the future.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I shall be so glad to be friends with you for
Rossie’s sake, if for no other,” he wrote in conclusion.
“She holds you in higher esteem than any living being;
so let her plead for me; and when we meet, as we sometimes
must, or Rossie be very unhappy, let it be at least
with the semblance of friendship.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Everard’s first impulse on receiving these letters was
to go to Florida at once and wrest Rossie from the
fangs of the wolf, as he stigmatized the doctor, in whom
he had no faith.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I cannot forgive him,” he said. “I will not, though
he were ten times her brother; and I distrust him, too,
notwithstanding his protestations of reform.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But he could not write this to Rossie. He said to
her in his letter that if her brother was all she represented
him to be, he was glad for her sake that she had
found him, and that he hoped always to be friendly with
her friends and those that were kind to her.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>“But if he were the archangel himself,” he added,
“I should find it hard to forgive him for having removed
from my grasp what I miss more and more every day of
my life, and long for with an intensity which masters
my reason and drives me almost to despair. But whatever
I may feel toward him, Rossie, I shall treat him well
for your sake, and if you can find any comfort in his
society, take it, and be as happy as you can.”</p>

<p class='c011'>To Dr. Matthewson he wrote in a different strain.
He did not believe in the man, and though he made an
effort to be civil he showed his distrust and aversion in
every line. If the doctor had repented, he was glad of
it, but wished the repentance had come in time to have
saved him from a life-long trouble. A <em>boy’s</em> cowhiding
was a small matter for a <em>man</em> to avenge so terribly, he
said, and then added:</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is no news to me that you are John Hastings,
Rossie’s half-brother. I knew that long ago, but kept it
to myself, as I did not wish Rossie to know how much
of my unhappiness I owed to her half-brother. Wholly
truthful and innocent, she thinks others are the same,
and if you tell her you are a saint she will believe it implicitly
until some act of your own proves the contrary.
She is very happy in your society, and I shall do nothing
to make her less so, but don’t ask me to indorse you cordially,
as if nothing had ever happened. The thing is
impossible. If we meet I shall treat you well for Rossie’s
sake, and shall not seek to injure you so long as you
are kind and true to her, but if you harm a hair of Rossie’s
head, or bring her to any sorrow, as sure as there is
a heaven above us, I’ll pursue you to the ends of the
earth to be even with you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was an amused smile on Dr. Matthewson’s face
as he read this letter, which showed him so plainly what
Everard’s opinion of him was. A meaning smile, too, it
was, and one which his enemy would hardly have cared
to see.</p>

<p class='c011'>“So ho! the young man threatens me,” he said to
himself. “I am glad he has shown his hand, though it
was foolish in him to do so, and proves that he is not
well up in fencing. I wonder what he wrote to Rossie;
and if she will show me the letter.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>Rossie could not show it to him, but when next they
met in her room, she said to him:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have heard from Everard, and he says that he is
glad I am so happy with you, and he will be friendly
with you always, and I do so hope you will like each
other. Have you, too, heard from him?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The doctor laughed a low, musical laugh, and drawing
his sister to him, said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“You cannot dissemble worth a cent. Don’t you
suppose I know that Everard’s letter to you was not all
you hoped it to be. He finds it hard to forgive me for
having deprived him of something which his maturer
manhood tells him is sweeter, more precious, and far
more to be desired than the object of his boyish passion.
And I cannot blame him. I am as sorry as he, in a different
way, of course, and you——”</p>

<p class='c011'>He did not finish the sentence, for Rossie broke away
from him, and burying her face in the cushions of the
couch on which they were sitting, burst into an uncontrollable
fit of weeping.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t,” she said, as he made an effort to soothe her.
“Don’t speak to me, please. I must have it out now. I
have kept it back so long. Oh, I wish I had died when
I was a little girl, and before I grew to be a woman,
with a woman’s love, which I must fight all my life, and
never know a moment of absolute rest and quiet. Oh,
why did you do it? Why did you separate me from my
love? for he is mine, and I am his. I was everything to
him; he was everything to me. Oh, Everard, just this
once I will say out what I feel. <em>I love you,—I love you</em>;
and I cannot help it. I know it is wicked, and try to
put it away. I bury it out of my sight; I trample on
it; I stamp upon it; I think I have the mastery over it,
and on the slightest provocation it springs into life more
vigorous than ever, and I <em>cannot</em> conquer it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She had said all she had to say, but she kept on
sobbing piteously, like one in mortal pain; and, hardhearted,
and utterly unprincipled, and selfish as he was,
Dr. Matthewson could not be wholly indifferent to a
grief such as he had never witnessed but once, and that
was years ago; but she who wept before him then was a
fair-haired German girl asking reparation for the ruin he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>had wrought. He had laughed at her, and telling her
she would make a splendid queen of tragedy, had bidden
her go upon the stage and achieve her fortune, then
come to him, and perhaps he would make terms with
her. But Rossie was a different creature. She knew
nothing of such girls as Yula Van Eisner. She was Rossie,
heiress of the Forrest property,—and he walked up
and down the room several times, and blew his nose vigorously,
and made a feint of wiping his eyes with his
perfumed handkerchief, and then came and stood by her,
and putting his hand on her bowed head, said to her:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t, Rossie, give way like this, or you will drive
me mad, knowing, as I do, that I have in one sense
caused your sorrow. If I could undo it, I would, but I
cannot. There is, however, a way out of it. Have you
ever thought how easily he might get a divorce, which
would make him free?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He would not be free;” and, lifting up her head,
Rossie flashed her bright black eyes upon him indignantly.
“The Bible would not recognize him as free,
neither would I, and you must not speak of such a thing
to me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then I will not,” he answered, still more soothingly;
“but Rossie, it is folly to give way like this,
though for this once I am glad you did. For now I understand
better the cause of these pale cheeks and irregular
pulse, and am sure you need entire change of air
and scene, such as you can only find in Europe, where we
are going in the spring. Think of a summer in Switzerland
among the glorious Alps. I know every rock, and
chasm, and winding path there, and shall be so happy in
seeing you enjoy them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He was speaking very kindly to her now, and she
gradually grew calm, and listened while he talked of
Europe and what they should see there, for he quite
decided that they would go in the spring, and as nothing
in the way of travel could suit Rossie better, she told
Mrs. Andrews the next day of the plan and wrote of it
to Everard, ignoring altogether his right as her guardian
to be consulted. But Everard did not resent it, though
for a time he felt half tempted to say that she should
not go, for a strong presentiment of evil swept over him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>with such force as to keep him awake the entire night.
But with the morning his nervous fears subsided, and he
could see no reasonable objection to Rossie’s going for
the summer to Europe with her brother, whose perfect
knowledge of the manners, and customs, and language
of the different countries must make him a very pleasant
traveling companion.</p>

<p class='c011'>Rossie had written that she should go directly from
Florida to New York, and so Everard wrote her his
farewell letter, and sent her a draft for five hundred
dollars, which he said she might need, as she would not
care to be altogether dependent upon her brother.
Rossie’s first impulse was to return the draft, but Dr.
Matthewson advised her to keep it and not wound Everard
by returning it to him.</p>

<p class='c011'>So Rossie kept it, or rather, gave it to her brother,
and sent a letter of thanks to Everard and another to
Bee, telling her of her intended journey, and bidding
her good-by.</p>

<p class='c011'>With that subtle and mysterious foresight with which
women seem to be gifted, and for which there is no explanation,
Beatrice anticipated danger at once, though
in what form she could not define. She only knew that
she wished Rossie was not going away alone with Dr.
Matthewson, but she kept her fears from Everard, and
wrote to Rossie that she should be in New York to see
her off. And when Rossie stood at last on the deck of
the <em>Oceanic</em>, Bee was there and Everard, too, taking his
last look at the face which would haunt him in the years
to come, as the faces of the dead haunt us when we feel
that by some act of ours interposed in time we might
have saved the life dearer than our own. Beatrice had
said to him:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am going to New York to see Rossie. Will you
go with me?” and without a moment’s reflection he went,
and spent one blissful day with her, a day never to be
forgotten, when he drove with her in the Park, and
watched the constantly changing expression of her sweet
face, which had grown so pale and thin that he was more
than half reconciled to let her go, hoping much from
the sea air and the new life she would lead. To the doctor
he was polite and courteous, and an ordinary observer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>might have thought them the best of friends, so that
Rossie was satisfied, and would have been quite happy if
she could have forgotten the distance which would so
soon intervene between them.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the whole Beatrice was favorably impressed with
Dr. Matthewson, who was so kind to Rossie and so
thoughtful for her that she dismissed her fears, and half
wished she, too, were going with them. She said as
much to Rossie when they stood upon the deck waiting
for the order to be given for all visitors to leave.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I’d give the world if you were,” Rossie cried.
“I should not feel as I do,—afraid, somehow, as if I was
never to return,—never to see you again, or Everard.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She was holding his hand in both hers as she spoke,
and in that moment of farewell she forgot everything
except the presentiment that she was going from him
forever; that their parting was final; and her tears fell
like rain as she bent over and kissed his hand, and said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good-by, Everard, good-by, and if it should be forever,
you’ll never forget me, will you?” These were her
parting words, which, in the after time, he said over
and over again, with a bitterer, heavier pain than that
he felt when with Bee he stood upon the Jersey shore,
and watched the <em>Oceanic</em> sailing down the bay.</p>

<p class='c011'>And so Rossie passed from their sight, and the next
they heard from her she had reached Liverpool, but was
greatly fatigued with the voyage, during which she had
been sick most of the time. It was only a few lines she
wrote to Everard, to tell him she was safe.</p>

<p class='c011'>“When I am stronger,” she said, “I will send you
and Beatrice a long letter, and tell you everything. Now
I can only sit by my window and look out upon the busy
streets of Liverpool and St. George’s Hall right opposite,
and occasionally there comes over me a feeling of something
like homesickness when I remember how far I am
from America and the friends who never seemed half so
dear to me as now, when I am so widely separated from
them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The next he heard from Rossie she was in London,
delightfully located in lodgings near Regent’s Park,
and playing keep house, while her brother was the best
and kindest man in the world, and she was very happy.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>Then they went to Switzerland, and Rossie’s letters
were full of the enthusiastic delight she felt with everything
around her. Of her health she seldom spoke, and
when she did, it was not altogether satisfactory. Sometimes
she was so tired that she had kept her room for
two or three days, and again a headache, or sore throat,
or cold, had confined her to the house for nearly a week;
but she was very happy among the Alps, and wished
that Beatrice and Everard were there with her to enjoy
what she was enjoying. As the summer advanced, however,
her letters were not so frequent, and the doctor
sometimes wrote for her, saying she was not feeling well,
and had made him her amanuensis. They were not to be
alarmed, he said; it was only a slight heart difficulty,
induced by the mountain air, which often affected tourists
in that way. He should take her to Southern France
early in the autumn, and then to Italy as the season advanced,
and should not return to America till spring.</p>

<p class='c011'>When Everard read this letter there came over him
again a great horror of some impending evil threatening
Rossie, and do what he might he could not shake it off.
He thought of it by day and dreamed of it by night,
and could he have found any good excuse for doing so,
he would have started for Europe, and kept near the
girl, who, it seemed to him, was in some imminent peril,
though of what nature he could not guess.</p>

<p class='c011'>Some time in November a letter came from Dr. Matthewson,
dated at Nice, where he said they had been for
two or three weeks, and where, as he expressed it, “I
hope our dear invalid is improving. Switzerland was
not the place for her, and she seemed to grow weaker
every day she staid there, so I hastened back to Paris,
and then came here, where she seems very happy, but is
weak as an infant. She complains of nothing but weariness,
and cannot get rested. Of course I have the best
medical advice for her, and everything is done which
can be to arrest the disease and give her some strength.
The physicians have forbidden her reading or writing,
even short letters, and I must do it for her for the present.
I hope that neither you nor Miss Belknap will be
needlessly distressed, for I assure you there is no immediate
danger, and with proper care, such as she has now,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>she will, I think, be quite able to return to America in
the spring. She is calling to me now from her chair by
the window, and says. ‘Tell them not to be troubled
about me; that I walked too much in Switzerland and
am not rested yet, but am so happy here in beautiful
Nice, looking out upon the blue Mediterranean.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>After this letter Rossie never wrote again, and though
Everard and Beatrice wrote frequently to her, asking her
to send them a line, if nothing more, Dr. Matthewson always
replied, “She is forbidden to write even so much
as her name;” and so the fall and winter crept on, and
Rossie was first in Venice, then in Florence, and then in
Rome. And then Dr. Matthewson wrote one day to
Everard, saying that Rossie did not know of this letter,
neither did he wish her to know, as it would only trouble
her and retard her recovery, but to be brief, he found
himself straitened for money just now, physicians
charged so abominably in Europe, and on account of
Rossie’s illness their expenses were, of course, much
heavier than they would otherwise have been, and if
Everard would make an advance for Rossie of a few
thousand dollars, he should be very glad. He was intending
to leave Rome early in the spring, and go to
Germany to a famous cure, where the prices were very
high.</p>

<p class='c011'>Double the amount of money asked for was placed at
the doctor’s disposal, and when that night Everard went
to Elm Park to call upon Beatrice, he said, in reply to
her inquiries for news from Rossie:</p>

<p class='c011'>“We shall never see her again.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XLII.<br> <span class='large'>ALAS, POOR ROSSIE!</span></h2>
</div>

<div class='c010'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/di_318.jpg' width='100' alt=''>
</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
It had been a long, dreary year to Everard,
and when the anniversary came round of the
day when Rossie sailed, it seemed to him
that he had lived in that year more than a
hundred lives. And yet, in a business point
of view he had been very prosperous, and money was
beginning to be more plenty with him than formerly,
though he could not lay by much, for Josephine made
heavy demands upon him. When she left Florida she
did not return to Rothsay, where she knew she was
looked upon with distrust by the better class. It was a
<em>dull, poky hole</em>, she said, and she should enjoy herself
better traveling, so she traveled from place to place
during the summer and autumn, and in the winter went
again to Florida,—but early in the spring she came back
to the Forrest House, where she lived very quietly, and
seemed to shun rather than court society. She, too,
knew of Rossie’s failing health, for she heard often from
the doctor, and she expressed so much anxiety for her
to Beatrice and Everard, hinting that they did not know
the worst, that their fears were increased, and suspense
was growing intolerable, when, at last, one morning in
May, the mail brought to Everard the <cite>American Register</cite>
from Paris, directed in a hand he had never seen before.</p>

<p class='c011'>Evidently it was sent from the office, and probably
had in it the whereabouts of some of his friends who
were traveling in Europe, and who occasionally forwarded
him a paper when they left one place for another.
Mr. Evarts was still abroad, and Everard ran his eye
over the list of names registered in different places to
see if his was there, for that the paper had anything to
do with Rossie he never dreamed. Indeed, she was not
in his mind, except as she was always there, in a general
way, and so the shock was all the greater and more terrible
when he came suddenly upon a little obituary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>notice, and read, with wildly-throbbing heart, and eyes
which felt as if they were starting from their sockets,
so great was the pressure of blood upon his brain:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Died, on the evening of April 20th, in Haelder-Strauchsen,
Austria, of consumption and heart disease,
Miss Rosamond Hastings, of Rothsay, Ohio, U. S. A.,
aged nineteen years and ten months. Seldom has death
snatched any one more lovely in person and character
than this fair young girl, who, in a strange land, far
from home, passed peacefully and willingly to the home
above, and whose last words to her weeping brother
were: ‘Don’t cry for me, and tell them at home not to
be sorry either. Heaven is as near me here in Austria
as it would be in America, and I am so glad to go.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>Everard could read no more, and throwing the paper
from him he buried his face in his hands, and for a few
moments gave way to such grief as men seldom feel, and
never experience but once in a life-time. He did not
weep; his pain was too great for tears; neither did any
word escape his livid lips, but his frame shook as with
an ague chill, and occasionally a long drawn, moaning
sob told how much he suffered, while great drops of
sweat gathered thickly upon his face, and in the palms
of his hands. No other blow could have smitten him so
heavily as he was smitten now. It is true he had felt a
great dread lest Rossie should die, but underlying
that was always the hope that she would come back
again. But all that was ended now, the little ray of
sunlight on his horizon had set in gloom, and the night
lay dark and heavy around him, with no rift in the
black clouds, no light in the future. Rossie was dead,
in all her freshness and youthful beauty; Rossie, who
had been to him a constant source of pleasure and joy,
since he first took her in his arms, a tiny little girl, and
kissed her pretty mouth in spite of her remonstrance,
“Big boys like oo mustn’t tiss nittle dirls like me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He had kissed her many times since as his sister,
and twice with all the intensity of a lover’s burning passion,
and once she had kissed him back, and he knew just
where her lips had touched him, and fancied he felt their
pressure again, and the perfume of her breath upon his
cheek. But, alas, she was dead, and the Austrian skies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>were bending above her grave in that far-off town with
the strange-sounding German name, which he had not
stopped to pronounce.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What was the name?” he asked himself, speaking
for the first time since he read the fatal news, and reaching
mechanically for the paper lying open at his feet.</p>

<p class='c011'>But his eyes were blood-shot and dim, and it took
him some time to spell out, letter by letter, the name
Haelder-Strauchsen, and to wonder where and what manner
of place it was where Rossie died, and if she were
lying under the flowers and soft green turf she loved so
much in life, and if he should ever see her grave.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, please Heaven!” he said, “I’ll find it some
day, and whisper to my darling sleeping there of the
love it will be no sin to speak of then. I’ll tell her how
with her life my sun of hope went down, never to rise
again.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, glancing once more at the paper, he read a
second time “Died, April 20th,” and tried to recall
what he was doing on that day, the darkest and saddest
which had ever dawned for him. Making allowance for
the difference in time between Austria and Ohio, it was
little past midday with him when it was evening over
there where Rosamond was dying, and with a shudder
he remembered how he was occupied then. Josephine
had written him a note, asking him to come to the Forrest
House as soon after lunch as possible, as she wished
particularly to see him. As he walked up the avenue to
the house, he had looked around sadly and regretfully at
the different objects which had once been so familiar to
him, and all of which had been so intimately associated
with Rossie. It was a lovely April day, and beds of
hyacinths and crocuses were in full bloom, and the daffodils
and double narcissuses were showing their heads
on the borders near the door. These had been Rossie’s
special care, and he had seen her so often working among
them, trowel in hand, with her high-necked, long-sleeved
apron on, that he found himself half-looking for her
now.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Rossie was not there; Rossie was dying far
away over the sea; and only Josephine met him in the
hall, civilly and haughtily, as had been her manner of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>late, and taking him into the reception-room where Rossie
used to come to him and vex him so with her long
dress and new airs of womanhood, told him she had an
invitation to visit a friend who lived in Indianapolis, and
who had invited her to spend the entire summer with
her, and she wished to know if he could furnish her with
money for the necessary outfit, and should she shut up
the house again and let Agnes go to Holburton, or
should she keep it open and leave Agnes in charge.</p>

<p class='c011'>He told her she could have the money, and said that
if Agnes wished to go to Holburton they might as well
shut up the house for the summer; and then he left her
and walked rapidly down the avenue, thinking of the
girl whose presence seemed to fill the place so completely
that once, when a bush near the carriage road rustled
suddenly as a rabbit darted away, he stopped, half
expecting to see a figure in white sun-bonnet and high-necked
apron spring out at him just as Rossie used sometimes
to do when she was a little child and he a well-grown
boy. And she was dying then, when he was
thinking so much of her, and she seemed to be so near
him. “Dying then and dead now,” he said, to himself,
just as a step was heard outside, and Lawyer Russell
came in, stopping short in alarm at the white, haggard
face which Everard lifted to him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is it, my boy? Are you sick? What has
happened? Tell me,” he asked; and motioning to the
paper on the floor, Everard answered sadly, “Rossie is
dead.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Rossie dead! No, no, Ned, it can’t be true,” Mr.
Russell said, and picking up the paper he read the
paragraph indicated by Everard, while a tear moistened
his eyelids and rolled down his cheeks.</p>

<p class='c011'>The old man had been very fond of Rossie, and for a
few moments he walked up and down the little back
office with his hands behind him and his head bent down,
then stopping suddenly he gave vent to the exclamation
“By George!” uttered in such a tone that Everard
looked up quickly and inquiringly, and said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is it? What’s the matter?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ned, my boy, look here. This may not be the time
nor place to speak of such a thing, but hanged if I can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>help it,” the lawyer replied, coming close to Everard
and continuing, “I take it that you considered Rosamond
Hastings to have been the lawful devisee to your
father’s estate.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know she was,” Everard said; and the lawyer went
on in a choking voice:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Poor little girl! She rebelled against it hotly,
and would have deeded it to you if she had lived to
come of age,—there’s nothing surer than that. But you
say she’s dead, and she not twenty yet till June, and
don’t you see, in spite of fate, the estate goes to her
brother, who is her heir-at-law, and that’s what I call
hard on you. I know nothing of the man except what
you have told me, but if the half of that is true, he is a
scamp, and will run through the property in a quarter of
the time it took to make it. Maybe, though, he has
some kind of honor about him, and if Rossie knew she
was going to die, you may be sure she put in a plea for
you, and perhaps he will divide; that’s the best you can
hope for. So we won’t despair till we hear from the
brother. There’s another mail from the north to-night.
A letter may come by that. It ought to have been here
with the paper. It’s a bad business all round,—very bad.
Rossie dead; poor Rossie, the nicest girl and most sensible
that ever was born, and the property gone to
thunder!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The old man was a good deal moved, and began again
to walk the floor, while Everard laid his head upon the
table in a half stupefied condition. Not that he then
cared especially what became of his father’s money,
though the thought that it would go to the man he hated
most cordially was a fresh shock to his nerves, but it
was nothing to losing Rossie. That was a grief which
it seemed to him he could not bear. Certainly he could
not bear it alone. He must tell it to some one who
would not, like Lawyer Russell, talk to him of money;
and when it began to grow dark, so that no one could
see how white and worn he was, he arose and walked
slowly up to Elm Park, sure of finding a ready and
hearty sympathy there.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Everard, what is it?” Beatrice asked, when
she first met him and saw his white, haggard face.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>He answered her as he had answered Mr. Russell,
“Rossie is dead,” and then seated himself again in the
chair from which he had arisen when she came in. Beatrice’s
tears were falling like rain, but Everard’s eyes
were as dry as if he had never thought to weep, and
there was such a fearful expression of anguish on his
face that Beatrice went up to him, and laying her hand
on his head, said, pityingly:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Everard, don’t look like that. You frighten
me. Cry, can’t you, just as I do? Tears would do you
good.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Cry?” he repeated. “How can I cry with this
band like red-hot iron around my heart, forcing it up to
my throat. I shall never cry again, or laugh, never.
Bee, I know you think me foolish and wicked, too, perhaps;
half the world would think it, and say I had no
right to love Rossie as I do, and perhaps I have not; but
the dearest, sweetest memory of my life is the memory
of what she was to me. I know she could never be
mine. I gave that up long ago, and still the world was
pleasanter to me because she was in it. Oh, Rossie, my
darling, how can I live on and know that you are dead?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Beatrice did not attempt to comfort him, for
she knew she could not, but she sat by him in silence until
he arose and went away, saying to her at parting, and
as if he had not told her before, “Rossie is dead.”</p>

The next day’s mail brought four foreign letters
to Rothsay,—one for Everard, one for
Beatrice, one for Josephine, and one for
Lawyer Russell. They were all mailed in
Vienna, within two days of each other, and
the one addressed to Everard was as follows:</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>“<span class='sc'>Vienna</span>, April —, ——.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Everard Forrest</span>:—<em>Dear Sir</em>—I hardly know
why I write to you first, unless it is because I know that
what I have to say will hurt you most; you, who I think
loved my darling Rossie. You have perhaps received
the <cite>American Register</cite> which I ordered to be sent you
from the office in Paris when I forwarded the notice, and
so you know why I write to you now. I have written to
you from time to time of Rossie’s failing health, but
never told you as bad as it was, for I did not wish to
alarm you unnecessarily, and kept hoping that change of
scene might bring the improvement I so greatly desired.
But nothing helped her, though she never complained of
anything but fatigue. ‘So tired,’ was all she ever said
of herself, and she seemed like some sweet flower fading
gradually.</p>

<p class='c013'>“At Haelder-Strauchsen, a little town among the
Austrian hills, I found she was not able to go on as I
wished to do, to Vienna, and so we staid there, where she
had the best of care. Neither of us thought the end so
near until the last day, when she failed rapidly, and
talked of you and Miss Belknap, and told me to tell you
how much she loved you both, and that you were not to
be sorry she was dead, for she was only going home, and
Heaven was as near Austria as it was to America. She
was so beautiful in her coffin, with a smile of peace upon
her face, as if she were resting at last. The people literally
covered her with flowers, and strangers’ tears fell
fast over her coffin as we laid her in the grave.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I shall come to America soon, and will tell you all
you wish to know with regard to her sickness and death,
and the many things she said of you, and your kindness to
her. I have a lock of her hair for you and Miss Belknap,
which I will bring with me.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And now good-by, and may Heaven pity us both
and make us better men for having had our Rossie even
for so short a time.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Truly,        <span class='sc'>John Matthewson</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>His letter to Beatrice was in substance much the same
as the one to Everard. There were a few more details
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>of Rossie’s illness, and a few more words which she said
at the last of her friends in America.</p>

<p class='c011'>Josephine’s letter no one saw, and if they had few in
Rothsay could have made it out, for it was written in
German, which Josephine could readily understand. One
or two sentences, however, deserve a place in our story,
and must accordingly be given. After indulging in a
good deal of sentimentalism with regard to Rossie’s
death, he added:</p>

<p class='c011'>“But as every cloud has its silver lining, so has this
dark pall which has overshadowed me so heavily. I can
now offer you wealth as well as love, and this I dare say
you will not object to. So, if you are not already at Indianapolis,
go there at once, and perhaps I will join you
there after I have paid my respects to Mr. Forrest.”</p>

<p class='c011'>To Lawyer Russell he wrote as follows:</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Vienna</span>, April —, ——.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Mr. Thomas Russel</span>:—<em>Dear Sir</em>—I have communicated
to Mr. Forrest the sad news of my sister’s
death, and need not enter into the particulars with you,
who will hear them from him. I write to you as the
family lawyer, on another subject of which I cannot now
speak to Mr. Forrest, lest he should misconstrue my
motive, and think me anxious and premature in what I
am about to say. As a lawyer of large experience you
have undoubtedly already thought of the fortune willed
to Rossie by Judge Forrest, and of which she died lawfully
possessed, and you have probably thought what
disposition would now be made of it. You know, of
course, that Rossie always protested it was not hers
rightfully, and that she should give it back to Everard
as soon as she reached her majority. I, however, who
am her lawful heir, do not see things as she did, and am
not disposed to throw away the good the gods provide.
Still I <em>am</em> disposed to be generous and make over to
Everard at once a portion of the property. As you must
know more about the estate than any one except Everard
himself, I wish you would be hunting up the matter, and
getting into shape some statement or estimate of the
value of the property, so there may be no unnecessary
delay when I come to Rothsay, as I shall do at once. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>have in New York a friend who is a shrewd, honest lawyer,
and I may bring him with me, not because I think
there will be any trouble or opposition to my claim, but
just to expedite matters and get them settled as soon as
possible.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hoping that you fully understand and appreciate
my motives, and that I shall find in you a friend and
adviser, I am, yours truly,</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>John Matthewson</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The old lawyer read this twice; then, with his hands
under his coat-tails and his glasses on the top of his
head, walked up and down his room, muttering to himself:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Just what I told Ned,—the man is a scoundrel, and
he will, with all his fine talk of generosity, bring a New
York lawyer here to see to it, as if he wouldn’t have fair
play and get every cent his due, though I’ll be blamed if
I wouldn’t take advantage of any quirk or loop-hole to
crawl out of, if there was one, which there isn’t. As
Rossie’s brother he is her heir, of course, and the whole
thing goes to him, for I’ll bet my head Ned will never
take a dollar. Poor boy, as if he hadn’t trouble enough
with the loss of the girl, without this new thing to
bother.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And if ever a man stood in need of sympathy it was
Everard, who seemed completely crushed, and who
looked so white and changed that even his best friends
forbore speaking to him of Rossie, though they talked
much of her among themselves, and many tears were
shed for the young girl who had been so great a favorite,
and whose grave was so far away. That Everard loved
her with more than a brother’s love was conceded now
by all, and no one thought to blame him for it, but pitied
him in his sorrow, which he did not try to conceal.
When Lawyer Russell took the doctor’s letter to him, and
asked what he thought of it, he evinced no surprise or
dissatisfaction.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s all right,” he said, “he is her heir, and he shall
have every dollar,—remember, every dollar. I would
not take it from her, I will not have it from him; and
you must do the business for me. I give it into your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>hands. I cannot confer with him; I should forget myself
sometime, and fly at his throat. I will give you all
the papers pertaining to the estate. I have kept the
matter perfectly straight, so there will be no trouble in
finding just how much he is worth. Now mind, don’t
you ever dare to think I will have a penny of the money,
for I will not, so help me Heaven! till Rossie rises from
her grave to give it to me. Then you may talk to me,
and not till then.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This was Everard’s decision, which both Mr. Russell
and Beatrice approved, though both mourned bitterly
over the fate which gave Judge Forrest’s hoarded stores
into the hands of one as unprincipled as Dr. Matthewson,
whose arrival was anxiously looked for.</p>

He stepped from the car one June afternoon, elegantly
habited in the latest Parisian style of
coat, and vest, and hat, with a band of crape
around the latter, and a grieved look on his
handsome face, as if he were thinking of the
dear little girl, dead so far away, and whose fortune
he had come to take. With him was a sharp,
shrewd-looking man, with round, bright eyes, which saw
everything at a glance, and a decidedly foreign accent.
To him the doctor always spoke in German, and in this
language the two talked together for a few moments after
alighting upon the platform in Rothsay. Evidently
they were not expected, for no one was there to meet
them, but the doctor inquired for the best hotel, and
making his way thither registered his own name and that
of his friend, “Walter Klyne, Esq., New York City.”
Then, engaging two of the best rooms in the house, and
ordering dinner at seven o’clock, he started out to reconnoiter,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>going first to Everard’s office and greatly astonishing
the young man, who did not know that he had yet
landed in New York. It might be thought, perhaps,
that the sight of him, with his band of crape upon his
hat, and the peculiar air of sadness he managed to infuse
into his voice and manner, would awaken in Everard a
feeling of sympathy and kindness for one in whose sorrow
he had so large a part, but it produced just the contrary
effect, and though he went forward with offered
hand to meet him, there swept over him a sensation of
distrust, and aversion, and dread,—a feeling of horror
for which he could not account, any more than he could
explain the sudden chill which crept through his veins,
as if Rossie’s cold, dead hands were touching his, and
Rossie’s white, still face pressed against his own.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dr. Matthewson was very polite and very much
afraid of wounding Everard’s feelings. He was sorry
not to find Mr. Russell there, he said, as he wished to talk
a little about business, and would like to go over the
Forrest House, which he believed was shut up.</p>

<p class='c011'>Everard gave him the keys, and added, hurriedly:</p>

<p class='c011'>“You will have no trouble whatever, as I have no intention
to dispute your right to the property. It was
lawfully Rossie’s, and, therefore, yours now.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was the first time Rossie had been mentioned, and
Everard felt as if his heart were bursting as he pronounced
the name, while the doctor’s lip quivered, and
he shut his eyes tight to keep the tears back.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thanks,” he said, as he took the offered keys. “We
will speak of business by and by, when I can trust myself
to tell you more fully what your sister’s wishes were.
Now, I only wish to see the house where she used to live.
I will return the keys on my way back to the hotel. I
wish you good evening, sir.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He lifted his hat courteously, and walked away with
his friend, while Everard watched him for a moment
with that same icy chill about his heart and the feeling
as if from the darkness and silence of her far-off grave
Rossie were beckoning to him and trying to warn him of
danger.</p>

<p class='c011'>Meantime the two gentlemen went rapidly along the
streets of Rothsay, where, as strangers, they were stared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>at by the people, who watched them until they turned
into the avenue leading to the Forrest House.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A splendid inheritance! I quite envy you, old boy,”
Walter Klyne said, as they ascended the broad steps and
stood upon the piazza.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, it will do very well for a country house, but it
will take a mint of money to fix it up as I’d like to have
it,” was the doctor’s reply, as he fitted the key to the
lock and entered the wide, old-fashioned hall, already beginning
to grow dim with the shadows of the late afternoon.
“It’s deuced cold, and damp, and ghost-like in
here; don’t you think so?” the doctor said, shivering a
little as he hurried on through room after room, hardly
seeing them at all, until he came to one, the door of
which was open as well as the blind opposite, so that a
flood of sunlight streamed through the window and fell
across the floor.</p>

<p class='c011'>“This is a jolly room; let’s go in here,” Klyne said,
entering himself, and looking curiously around, while the
doctor stood by the threshold, wiping from his face
great drops of sweat, and starting at every sound, as if
he fancied the place full of something harmful. “Why,
Doc, what ails you? You are white as a sheet. What’s
the matter?” Klyne asked, and the doctor replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nothing, only this was her room; Rossie’s, you
know. I am sure of it; she described it to me so often,
and I feel as if she was here with us; I do, upon my
soul. That’s her chair, where she used to sit, and these
must be her books, and that’s her bed where she used to
sleep. Let’s go away; it’s like a graveyard to me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He seemed so excited that his friend looked at him
curiously, wondering if the glass of wine taken just before
they left the hotel had affected his brain, or if it
really was true that his grief for his sister was augmented
by the sight of her old home, and the objects
which had once made a part of her life.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s not like John Matthewson to love any one like
that. There’s a kink somewhere,” he thought, as he left
the room and followed on through one apartment after
another, until the whole had been gone through, and they
went out into the open air, where the doctor seemed to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>be more at his ease. Taking off his hat and wiping his
forehead, where the perspiration was standing, he said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“This is a confounded hot night after all, or I am no
judge of the weather, and this place in particular seems
hotter than Tophet. I say, Walt, do you believe in
ghosts, or haunted houses, or any of that sort of nonsense?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of course not. Why do you ask?” Walter Klyne
said; and the doctor replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Because I was just nervous enough to fancy that
the whole Forrest race, Rossie and all, were after me as
I went over the lonesome old hut. Maybe they don’t
like the idea of my being the heir, and that has brought
them from their graves; but I feel better now, and
I think we will be going, or the dinner will be cold.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Early next morning the doctor interviewed Lawyer
Russell, and at the close of the conference the doctor
knew that as Rossie’s heir he was entitled to several
hundred thousand dollars, some in lands and houses, some
in bonds and mortgages, some in railroad shares and
some in ready cash. The amount, so far exceeding what
he had expected, surprised and delighted him, and inclined
him to be very generously disposed toward Everard,
with whom he had one long talk. He had taken all the
necessary steps to prove that Rossie died at Haelder-Strauchsen,
Austria, on the evening of April 20th; he
had sworn to that effect before the lawful authority; and
he was accepted by the public as the heir, though under
protest, for there was no one in Rothsay who did not think
it was a shame for Everard to be so defrauded of what
ought always to have been his. This feeling the doctor
perfectly understood, and it strengthened his resolution
to be very generous toward the young man, to whom he
offered half of the entire estate.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Perhaps I ought to give you the whole,” he said,
“but hanged if I can quite bring myself to that. You
see, when a poor chap like me gets a little money it is
mighty hard to give it up.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But I thought you had unlimited means in Europe,”
Everard said; and without the slightest change of countenance
the doctor replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I did have something there, though not so much as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>Rossie supposed. I deceived her purposely, thinking she
would feel easier if she believed me very rich. But
unluckily the firm failed where most of my money was
deposited, so that I am much poorer now than when I
went from America more than a year ago.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He seemed to be in earnest, and insisted that Everard
should take half the property, until the latter stopped
him by saying decidedly:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Your talk is all in vain, for I shall never take a dollar
of that money. It would prove a curse to me if I
did. I do not want it, I will not have it, and I only ask
that I hear no more on the subject.” So saying he rose
suddenly from his chair and left the room. The interview
was ended; the doctor had discharged his duty;
and it was not his fault that he was a richer man by more
than two hundred thousand dollars than he expected to
be. On the whole, he felt quite satisfied with matters as
they were, and would not quarrel with the good luck
which had made him so rich that he need never again
feel a moment’s anxiety.</p>

<p class='c011'>He had nothing more to do but to enjoy himself, and
let others do so too, for that was part of his creed.
Naturally generous and free, he was always ready to
share his fortune with others, and he made up his mind
at once to be very popular in Rothsay, and to begin by
liberal gifts to every public and charitable object, as that
was sure to win him favor. Walter Klyne, who served
no purpose whatever, was retained, nominally as legal
adviser, but really because under his smooth, placid exterior
the doctor carried a coward’s heart, and did not
like to be alone at the Forrest House, where he soon
took up his quarters. There was an odor of aristocracy
about the place which he liked, for it reminded him of
some of the palaces in Europe which he had coveted,
envying the possessor, and fancying how happy he
should be were he the lord and owner. He was lord
and owner now, with an income of more money than he
had ever had at any one time in his life. He had men-servants
and maid-servants, and fast horses, and carriages,
and hunting-dogs, and choice cigars by the hundreds,
and rare wines, which he drank as freely as water.
He ordered several costly pictures from Munich and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>Dresden, with statuary from Florence, and filled the
halls and grounds with the latter, and fitted up a gallery
for the former, and set up to be a connoisseur and critic
general of fine art, and gained considerable reputation
in that line, and was spoken of as a highly cultivated
and generous man, of whom Rothsay would have been
glad if his coming there had not been brought about by
the death of the sweet young girl, whose memory was so
fresh and green in the minds of her friends. He had the
most expensive pew in church, and was present every
Sunday morning, and joined reverently in the service,
though his preference, he frankly said, was for the plain
Methodist chapel; and he made no secret that he had
once been a Methodist clergyman, and said he should
return to that body were it not that Rossie loved the
church as a child loves its mother, and for her sake he
should be a churchman, and instruct himself in all its
usages and doctrines. So the Episcopalians claimed him,
and made much of him, and took his gifts thankfully,
and rejoiced that at last the Forrest money, which the
judge had held so tightly, was being distributed among
them in so liberal a manner. Could they have had their
choice they would rather have seen Everard in his father’s
house. Dr. Matthewson was genial and pleasant, and
very generous, but in some sense he was an interloper,
while Everard was to the manor born; the purple was
his by birth; the blue blood of Forrest and Bigelow
was in his veins, and the people sympathized with and
pitied him more than he ever dreamed.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a very lonely life which he led that summer
after Rossie’s death; and with the exception of Beatrice
he seldom talked with any one, except upon business.
He could not mingle with his old friends and seem as he
used to do, with that sad memory constantly in his heart;
that grave always yawning before him, where he had
buried his darling. A thought of Rossie was always
with him; not as he saw her last, standing on the deck
and waving him her farewell, with tears swimming in
her eyes, and a look upon her face whose meaning he
could readily interpret, but as she was when a little girl
sporting on the terrace behind the house, or romping on
the grounds, with the white sun-bonnet hanging down
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>her back, the strings chewed into a hard knot, her hair
blowing about her face, and her starry eyes brightening
when he joined her with his raillery and teasing jokes.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sometimes in the stillness of the night he almost
fancied that he heard again the quick tread of the busy
feet which had run so willingly for him, and always when
his grief was at its height, and his heart aching the
worst, he felt that pale, thin hands were beckoning him
from out the darkness of the grave, beckoning him to
come, as if the spirit could not rest until it was joined
by his. Once, when the impression was very strong
upon him, and it almost seemed as if the dead hands
touched his and were leading him away, he said, aloud:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Rossie, are you here? Is there something you want
me to do, and are you trying to tell me? I’d go to the
ends of the earth at your slightest bidding.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But to this appeal no answer came from the far-off
grave across the sea, though the hands still seemed
beckoning with a never-tiring persistence which moved
and troubled him greatly. Had he been at all tainted
with spiritualism as it exists in modern times, he might
perhaps have sought through mediums to know what his
love would tell him, but he was free from superstitions
of all kind, except this one, that Rossie was calling to
him, and that ere long it would be granted him to join
her in the world beyond. And to this end he tried to
make himself ready, praying earnestly as he never prayed
before that God would lead him to himself in any path
he chose, so that it conducted him at last to Heaven,
where Rossie was. Well he knew that if he would find
that rest, all sinful affections must be overcome, and he be
made humble and submissive as a little child. At first,
however, it was very hard to be submissive and humble,
and harder still not to hate the man who had blasted his
whole life, and who seemed to be riding triumphantly in
the high and pleasant roads of success. But gradually
the hardness began to give way as the new life within
him became clearer and brighter, and though he could
not bring himself to like the doctor or find pleasure in
his society, he could endure his presence, and no longer
crossed the street to avoid meeting him if he saw him
coming in the distance, and that was about all the progress
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>he could make with him. He distrusted and disliked
him, and never on any occasion went near the Forrest
House, which, as the summer advanced, the doctor
filled with his friends from New York, men of his own
class, who were as unlike Everard as he was unlike his
former self when he rebelled hotly against his fate and
blamed the Almighty for having dealt so hardly with
him. He did not feel that way now, and every Sunday
found him an occupant of his father’s old pew, where
Rossie used to sit, and where he now knelt and prayed
earnestly for grace to bear whatever might be in store
for him, feeling, it is true, that nothing worse could happen
to him than had already happened,—the loss of
Rossie and the loss of his estate.</p>

<p class='c011'>From Josephine he seldom heard. She was still in
Indianapolis with her friends, but she did not write him
often, and never asked for money.</p>

<p class='c011'>He had sent her a Rothsay paper which had in it a
column and a half of matter concerning the disposition
of the Forrest property, and the new proprietor, but she
had made no comment. That she could not live at the
Forrest House he knew, and that she would not return to
Rothsay he devoutly hoped, and so he grew more quiet
and contented each day, though there was ever with him
a sense of bitter pain and a constant thought of the grave
across the sea where Rossie was buried.</p>

<p class='c011'>And so the summer waned, and September came and
went, and one morning in October a bombshell was
thrown into Rothsay which made Everard stagger for a
moment from the suddenness of its coming; then he rallied,
and his first sensation was one of intense relief, such
as the prisoner feels when told that ere long he will be
free again to go and come as he likes.</p>

<p class='c011'>It came first in the form of an article published in the
Rothsay <cite>Star</cite>, and which was as follows:</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Divorce in High Life.</span>—We learn from a friend
residing in Indianapolis that there is a divorce suit pending
between two parties well known in Rothsay. The
gentleman, in fact, is still a resident here, but the lady is
at present in Indianapolis, where she went last May with
the intention of getting the divorce.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>Everard read this article twice before fully comprehending
its meaning. Then, when he knew <em>he</em> was one
of the parties meant, that it was the Forrest name which
must be mixed with the affair, his first feeling was one
of shame and mortification, notwithstanding that he had
once contemplated doing just what Josephine was doing
for him. But his next feeling was one of intense relief
that at last he would be free from the burden which had
borne so heavily upon him. He went with the notice to
Beatrice, who, although she disapproved of divorces as a
rule, looked upon this as an exceptional case, and was
glad for him. Of course all Rothsay talked, and gossiped,
and wondered, but asked no questions of Everard,
who, outwardly, was just the same, and came and went
as if nothing had happened or was likely to happen.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dr. Matthewson seemed as much surprised as any
one, but offered no opinion whatever on the subject, and
after a few days he went to New York with his inseparable
friend and adviser, Walter Klyne. Four weeks
later a notice was sent to Everard to the effect that a
divorce from him had been granted to his former wife,
who chose to take her maiden name, and was again
Josephine Fleming; also, that he, too, was divorced,
with a right to marry again, if he chose.</p>

<p class='c011'>From that time onward Everard was a changed man.
It is true that Rossie was always in his mind, and he never
for a moment forgot the pain and loss, which it seemed
to him grew greater every day, but the consciousness
that Josephine had no claim upon him made him in one
way very happy, and he felt freer from care and anxiety
than he had done since that fatal night when he made
the mistake of his life. That Josephine would marry
again he was confident, and it did not need Beatrice’s
hint, cautiously given, to awake in his mind a suspicion
as to who the man would be; and still it was a shock
when it came to him early in the spring that the Forrest
House was to have a mistress, and that its last occupant
was coming back with a right to rule and reign and
spend his father’s money as she chose.</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
Doctor Matthewson had spent most of
the winter in New York, but of Josephine’s
whereabouts little was known. She had been
in New York, and Holburton, and Boston,
where she was the guest of Mrs. Arnold,
with whom she had been abroad, and whose good
opinion she had succeeded in retaining by telling her a
part only of the truth, and doing it in such a manner
that she appeared to be the party to be pitied rather
than Everard. Mrs. Arnold was not a person who looked
very deeply into matters, she chose rather to take them
as they seemed, and Josephine had been very faithful to
her and her interest while they were abroad; and though
she was shocked and surprised when she first heard the
story of the marriage, Josephine told it so well for herself
as to make it appear that she had not been greatly in
fault, and the lady believed her more sinned against than
sinning, and invited her to her own home in Boston,
where she was stopping somewhere about the middle of
March, when word came to the man in charge of the Forrest
House that the doctor, who had already been gone
two months and more, would remain away still longer,
and that when he returned Mrs. Matthewson would
accompany him. Who Mrs. Matthewson was the letter
did not state, but Beatrice readily guessed, and was not
at all surprised when, a week later, she received a letter
from Mr. Morton, who was still in Boston, and who
wrote that he had been asked to officiate at the marriage
of Miss Josephine Fleming with Dr. John Matthewson,
said marriage to take place at the house of one of his
parishioners, Mrs. Arnold, April 15th, at eleven o’clock,
<span class='fss'>A. M.</span></p>

<p class='c011'>What Everard thought or felt when he heard the
news he kept to himself, but the townspeople unanimously
disapproved of the match, and arrayed themselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>against the bride elect and decided that she
should be made to feel the weight of their disapprobation,
and know that they resented her marriage and
coming back there to live as an insult to Everard and an
affront to themselves. Nor were they at all mollified by
the arrival of <em>cards</em> inviting them to the wedding. There
were in all a dozen invitations sent to as many families
in Rothsay, and Beatrice had a letter from Josephine,
in which she tried to make everything seem fair and
right with regard to the divorce and marriage, and
hoped Miss Belknap would be friendly with her when
she came back to Rothsay.</p>

<p class='c011'>“For myself,” she added, “I would rather not go
where Everard is, and where his friends can hardly wish
to see me. But the doctor is inexorable, and insists
upon living at Rothsay a portion of the year at least.
He likes the Forrest House, he says, and would not sell
it for the world. It suits him for a summer residence,
and we shall be there some time in June. He is very
kind, and I trust that after the stormy life I have led
there is a bright future in store for me, which, I assure
you, I shall appreciate, and if I can atone for whatever
has been wrong and questionable in the past I certainly
shall do so.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And to do Josephine justice, she did mean to retrieve
her character if possible, and be at least a true wife to
the man who had chosen her, knowing perfectly well
what she was and how little to be trusted. There was
about Josephine a most powerful fascination for Dr.
Matthewson, who thought her the most beautiful and
attractive woman he had ever seen. And the doctor
liked beautiful and attractive things; they suited his
luxurious tastes, and Josephine was just the one to adorn
the kind of home he was now able to have. She would be
equal to any emergency, and he would enjoy the attentions
she was sure to receive at the different watering-places
and hotels, where he meant to take her. If any
of her admirers should become too demonstrative he
could easily rid himself of them and bring his wife under
subjection, for he meant to be her master, and to do exactly
as he pleased in everything, and he made a beginning
by refusing to sell the Forrest House, as she wished
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>him to do. For Josephine was determined not to go
back to Rothsay, and at first made it a condition in marrying
the doctor that he should dispose of the place, or
at least not require her to live there even for a few
weeks. She had no wish to meet Everard, or to come in
contact with his friends, who were sure to slight her now.
But the doctor was resolved upon making the house into
a kind of palace, where he could enjoy himself after his
own ideas, and as he had not the slightest consideration
for the wishes or feelings of others, he laughed at Josephine’s
scruples, which he called whims, and carried his
point with regard to the Forrest House, and the evening
of the 15th of April there appeared in the Boston papers
the following notice:</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Married</span>, this morning at ten o’clock, by the Rev.
Theodore Morton, Dr. John Matthewson to Miss Josephine
Fleming.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Washington and New York were the cities where
the happy pair spent their honeymoon, and it was not
until the middle of June that they took possession of
their Rothsay house, which had undergone quite a
transformation. All through the months of April and
May carpenters from Cincinnati had been there, following
out the plan which the doctor had forwarded to them
with the most minute instructions. Bay-windows were
sent out here, and hanging balconies there, and pretty
little sunny nooks for plants were cut through the solid
mason-work; rooms were thrown together, trees were
removed to admit more light and give finer views, until
the stately, old-fashioned house assumed the appearance
of a modern and rather graceful structure, which the
Rothsayites, and even Beatrice herself, thought greatly
improved. Every room was refurnished and changed in
some way except Rossie’s,—which was left untouched.
Not an article of furniture was changed or moved from
its place. Some of Rossie’s books were on the shelf
where she left them; a work-box was on the table, and
in the closet one or two half-worn dresses hung, a prey
to any moth or insect which chose to fasten upon them.
But the rest of the house was beautiful, and fresh, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>new, and ready for the bride, who came one afternoon
in June, and was met at the station by the coachman,
with the new carriage and high-stepping horses, which
pawed the ground and arched their glossy necks as the
long train swept by.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was no one there to meet the bride, for the
marriage was very unpopular in town, and every door
was virtually closed against the lady who, for once in
her life, looked pale and tired, as she took her seat in the
carriage, and leaning back wearily, said, to the doctor:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Please take the straightest road home, for I am
tired to death.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But if the doctor heard her he did not heed her request.
He had no feelings of shame or twinges of conscience.
He wished the people to see his splendid turnout,
and they drove through Main street, past all the
shops and offices, where the men and boys stared at them,
and a few made a show of recognizing the courteous
lifting of the doctor’s hat, and the patronizing wave of
his hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>Josephine was closely vailed, and pretended not to see
the ladies who were on the street, and who did not turn
their heads as the elegant carriage went by. But Josey
knew that they saw her, and felt that her worst fears
were to be realized; and when, at a sudden turn in the
road, they came upon Beatrice, whose cool little nod
seemed more an insult than a recognition, her cup of
humiliation was full, and there were tears of mortification
and anger in her eyes, and her headache was not
feigned when at last they drew up before the house,
where a strange woman was waiting to greet them. This
was Mrs. Rogers, the housekeeper, imported for that
purpose from Cincinnati, as were the other servants.
These, however, had all heard the antecedents of their
new master and mistress very freely discussed, and the
result was that a mutiny was already in progress, for, as
the girl who held the post of scullion said, “she had lost
one <em>cha-rac-ter</em> by living with folks who wasn’t fust cut,
and she didn’t care to lose another.” Still, the wages
were good, and all decided to stay a while, and see what
the lady who had two husbands living and had once been
a servant herself (such was the story as they had it) was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>like. So they came to meet her, and thought her very
handsome and stylish, and a fit occupant of the beautiful
rooms of which she was mistress, and for which she did
not seem to care, for she never stopped to look at them,
but went directly to her own apartments, which she did
have the grace to say were pretty.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, it is all very nice,” she said to the doctor, “but
I am frightfully tired, and nervous, too, I think. This
last hot day’s ride has just upset me. I believe I’ll have
a cup of tea brought to my room, and not go down to
dinner, if you’ll excuse me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You won’t do any such thing,” was the doctor’s reply.
“You’ll put on one of your swell-dresses, and go
down to dinner with me. I wish the servants to see you
at your best, and somebody may call this evening.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Somebody call!” Josephine retorted, with intense
bitterness in her voice. “Don’t flatter yourself that any
one whom I care for will call to-night, or ever, while I
remain in Rothsay.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, what do you mean?” the doctor asked, and
she replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I mean that as Everard Forrest’s divorced wife,
married to another man, I am to be tabooed in this town.
Didn’t you notice how the ladies we passed on the street
pretended to be looking another way so as not to see me.
They did not wish to recognize me even with a nod, and
you surely noticed the insulting bow which Miss Belknap
gave me. There was not a particle of cordiality in it. I
knew it would be so, and that was why I was so opposed
to coming here. I wish I had remained firm to my first
resolution.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She was more than half crying with anger and vexation,
but the doctor only laughed at what he termed her
groundless fears. Supposing she was a divorced woman,
with her first husband living in the same town, what did
that matter? He knew of many such instances, and if
the people in Rothsay were disposed to slight him at
first, he should live it down, for money could accomplish
everything.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Josephine was not to be soothed by his words,
and bade him mind his business and leave her to herself.
It was the first ebullition of temper she had shown
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>toward him; so he received it good-humoredly, and
touched her playfully under her chin, and had his way
in everything, and took down to dinner a most beautiful
and elegantly-dressed woman, who looked as if made
for just the place she was occupying at the head of that
handsomely appointed table.</p>

<p class='c011'>No one called either that evening, or the next, or the
next, and when Sunday came she was really sick with
mortification and disappointment, and the doctor went to
church without her, and met only cold words from those
to whom he tried to talk after service was over. Nobody
mentioned his wife, although he spoke of her himself,
and said that she was sick, and asked Mrs. Rider to tell
her husband to call in the afternoon and see her. Even
that ruse failed, for there was no solicitude expressed for
the lady’s health, no inquiry as to what ailed her, and
the doctor drove home in his handsome carriage, feeling
that after all Josephine might be right, and that the people
were determined to show their disapprobation. But
he meant to live it down, and not let the good fortune
he had so coveted turn to ashes on his hands. But living
it down was not so easy as he had supposed, and as day
after day went by, and no one came to see his grandeur,
or paid the least attention to him, his spirits began to
flag, and he half-suspected that he had made a mistake
in bringing his wife to Rothsay, where the Forrest star
was evidently in the ascendant.</p>

<p class='c011'>Once he decided to fill the house with young men
from New York and Cincinnati, but when he thought of
Josey he gave that up, for his love, or rather passion,
for her was strong enough to make him wish to keep her
smiles and blandishments for himself; and so the New
York guests were given up, and he spent his time driving
his fast horses through the country during the morning,
and in the afternoon lounging, and smoking, and reading,
and looking over his handsome house until his elaborate
dinner, which was served at half-past six, and notice
of which was given to the portion of the town
nearest him by the loud bell which he caused to be rung
as a signal to himself and wife that dinner was ready.
The doctor was very particular and exacting on every
point of table etiquette, and required as much form, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>ceremony, and attention, as if a multitude of guests sat
daily at his board, instead of himself and Josephine,
who was always elegantly dressed in silks, and laces, and
diamonds, and looked a very queen as she took her seat
at the head of her table with a languor which was
not feigned, for in her heart she was tired and sick to
death of the grand, lonely life she led. Nobody came
near her, and when by chance she met any of her old
acquaintances they were too much hurried to do more
than bow to her; while even the tradespeople lacked that
deference of manner which she felt was her due. The
doctor seldom asked her to join him in his drives, and as
she did not care to go out alone and face the disapproving
public, she spent her time mostly in her room reading
French novels and eating candy and bonbons, with
which she was always supplied.</p>

<p class='c011'>Everard she had never met face to face, though she
had seen him in the distance from her window, and
watched him as he went by with a strange feeling at her
heart which wrung a few hot, bitter tears from her, as
she remembered the summer years ago when her boy-lover
was all the world to her, and the life before her
seemed so fair and bright. Not that she really wanted
Everard back, but she wanted something; she missed
something in her life which she longed for intensely, and
at last made up her mind that it was Agnes, the despised
sister, who was in Holburton, earning her own living as
housekeeper for Captain Sparks.</p>

<p class='c011'>When they first returned to the Forrest House, Dr.
Matthewson had signified to her his wish that Agnes
should remain where she was. She would hardly be
ornamental in his household, he said. He liked only
beautiful objects around him, and Agnes was not beautiful.
She would be an ugly blot upon the picture, and he
did not want her, though he was willing to supply her
with money, if necessary. But Agnes did not wish for
his money. She could take care of herself, and was
happier in Holburton than she could be elsewhere. But
as the summer went by, the longing in Josephine’s heart
for the companionship of some woman grew so strong
that she ventured at last to write, begging her sister to
come, and telling how lonely she was without her.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>“I have been hard and selfish, and wicked, I know,”
she wrote, “but, Aggie, I am far from being happy, and
I want you here with me so much that I am sure you
will come. I believe I am sick or nervous, or both, and
the sight of your dear old face will do me good.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Josephine did not tell her husband of this letter, lest
he should forbid her sending it. She was beginning to
be a good deal afraid of him, but she thought she knew
him well enough to feel sure that if Agnes were once in
the house he would make no open opposition to it, and
she was willing to bear a good deal in private for the sake
of having her sister with her again. So she wrote her
letter, and as the day was fine, took it to the post-office
herself, in order to insure its safety.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XLVI.<br> <span class='large'>THE LETTER FROM AUSTRIA.</span></h2>
</div>

<div class='c010'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/di_343.jpg' width='100' alt=''>
</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
There had been some trouble with the clerks
in the post-office at Rothsay, and two new
ones had just been appointed, and one of
these had entered upon his duties only the
day before. As he came from Dayton, and
was a stranger in town, he knew very few people by
sight, and was altogether ignorant of the name and antecedents
of the beautiful lady, who, after depositing her
letter, asked if there was any mail for the Forrest House.
Half-bewildered with her beauty and the bright smile
she flashed upon him, the clerk started and blushed, and
catching only the name Forrest, looked in Everard’s box,
where lay a letter not yet called for, as Everard had left
town early that morning for a drive into the country,
where he had some business with a client. It was a soiled-looking
letter, with a foreign post-mark upon it, and had
either been mislaid a long time after it had been written,
or detained upon the road, for it was worn upon the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>edges, and had evidently been much crumpled with frequent
handling. It was directed to J. Everard Forrest,
Esq., Rothsay, Ohio, U. S. A., and in a corner, the two
words, “Please forward” were written, as if the writer
were in haste and thought thus to expedite matters.</p>

<p class='c011'>Very mechanically, and even indifferently, Josephine
took it in her hand, and glancing at the name saw the
clerk had made a mistake and given her what belonged
to another. But she saw, too, something else, which
turned her white as ashes, and riveted her for a moment
to the spot with a feeling that she was either dying or
mad, or both. <em>Surely</em>, she knew that writing. She had
seen it times enough not to be mistaken. And she had
thought the hand which penned it dead long ago, and
laid away under the grass and flowers of Austria. “<em>Rossie</em>,”
she tried to say, but her white lips would not move,
and there was about them a strange prickling sensation
which frightened her more than the numbness of her body.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I must get into the air where I can breathe,” she
thought, and with a desperate effort she dragged herself
to the street, taking the letter with her, and grasping it
with a firm grip as if fearful of losing it, when in fact
she had forgotten that she had it at all, until the air
blowing on her face revived her somewhat and brought
her back to a consciousness of what she was doing.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then her first impulse was to return the letter to
Everard’s box, and she turned to go back when she saw
her husband entering the office, and that decided her.
She would not let him see the letter, for if there <em>were</em> a
great wrong somewhere, <em>he</em> knew it and had contrived
it, and the cold sweat broke out from every pore as
she began dimly to conjecture the nature of the wrong,
and to shudder at its enormity. She was feeling stronger
now, and fearful lest her husband should overtake her
she hurried across the common toward home, where she
went at once to her room, and, locking the door, sat
down to read that letter from the dead. She had made
up her mind to do that during her rapid walk. She
must know its contents, and so she broke the seal
and began to read. And as she read she felt the
blood curdle in her veins; there was a humming in her
ears; a thick feeling in her tongue, and a kind of consciousness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>that she was somebody else, whose business
for the rest of her life was to keep the letter and its contents
a secret from the world. But where should she
hide it that no one could ever find it, for nobody must
see it? Safety, honor, <em>everything</em> dear to her depended
upon that. Not even her husband must look upon it or
know that it was written; and where should she put it
that he would not find it, for he took the liberty to look
through her private drawers and boxes just when it
pleased him to do so? She could not put the letter in a
box or keep it about her person, and she dared not destroy
it, though she made the attempt and lighted the gas
in which to burn it to ashes. But as she held it to the
blaze something seemed to grasp her hand and draw it
back. And when she shook off the sensation of fear
which had seized her, and again attempted the destruction
of the note, the same effect was produced, and an
icy chill crept over her as if it were a dead hand clutching
hers and holding it fast.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I can’t destroy it; I dare not!” she whispered; “and
what if somebody should find it? What if <em>he</em> should?
He told me once that he had been guilty of every sin but
murder, and under strong provocation he might be led
to do even that;” and a shudder of fear ran through her
frame as she cast about in her own mind for a safe hiding-place
for the letter which affected her so strangely.
Suddenly it came to her that she could loosen a few tacks
in the carpet, just where the lace curtains covered the
floor in a corner of the bay window, and pushing the letter
out of sight, drive the tacks in again, and so the secret
would be safe, for a time at least. To do her justice,
for once in her life conscience was prompting her
to the only right course left her to pursue,—give the letter
to Everard and abide the consequences. But she
could not make up her mind to do this, knowing that utter
poverty and disgrace would be the result, and she
had learned by this time that poverty with Dr. Matthewson
would be a far different thing from poverty with
Everard.</p>

<p class='c011'>To hide the letter under the carpet was the work of
a moment, and, unlocking the door, she was going for a
hammer, with which to drive the tacks, when she heard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>her husband’s voice in the hall below, and knew that he
was coming. He must not know that she held his guilty
secret, lest he should murder her, as in her nervousness
she felt that he might do, and so she retraced her steps
to the couch, where she lay half fainting, and as white
as marble, when the doctor entered the room and asked
her what was the matter.</p>

<p class='c011'>She did not know, she said; she had been down
to the village and walked rather fast, and was very
warm, and had drank freely of ice-water, which made
her feel as if her head were bursting. She should probably
feel better soon.</p>

<p class='c011'>But she did not get better, and she lay all that day
and the next upon the couch, and seemed so strange and
nervous that her husband called in Dr. Rider, who, after
a few questions, the drift of which she understood, and
to which she gave false replies for the purpose of misleading
him, assigned a cause for her ailments, and then
went away. Thus deceived, and on the whole rather
pleased than otherwise, Dr. Matthewson was disposed
to be very attentive and indulgent to his wife, with
whom he sat a good portion of each day, humoring all
her whims and trying to quiet her restless, nervous state
of mind.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You act as if you were afraid of me, Josey,” he said
once, when he sat down beside her and put his arm
around her with something of the old lover-like fondness.
“You tremble like a leaf if I touch you, and shrink
away from me. What is it? What has come between
us? You may as well tell, for I am sure to find it out
if there is anything.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She knew that, and it seemed to her as if his eyes
were following hers to the bay window and seeing the
letter hidden under the carpet. She must say something
by way of an excuse, and with her ready tact she answered
him: “I <em>am</em> keeping something from you. I
have written Aggie to come to me. I was so lonesome
and sick, and wanted her so much. You are not angry,
are you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Her great blue eyes were swimming with genuine
tears, for she was a little afraid of what her husband
might say to the liberty she had taken without his permission.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>Fortunately, he was in one of his most genial
moods. Dr. Rider had said to him privately that in her
present nervous condition Josephine must not be crossed;
and he answered laughingly that he was not angry, but
on the contrary, very glad Aggie was coming, as he
believed her a capital nurse; and “Josey,” he added,
“you need building up. You are growing as thin as a
shad and white as a sheet, and that I don’t like. I thought
<em>you</em> would never fade and fall off like Bee Belknap. I
met her this morning, and she positively begins to look
like an old maid. I hear she is to be married soon,” and
he shot a keen, quick glance at his wife, into whose pale
cheeks the hot blood rushed at once, and whose voice
was not quite steady as she asked:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Married,—to whom? Not Everard?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No-o,” the doctor answered, contemptuously, annoyed
at Josephine’s manner. “I hope she has more
sense than to marry that milksop, who has grown to be
more like a Methodist parson than anything else. You
called him a milksop yourself, once,” he continued, as he
saw the flash in Josephine’s eyes, “and you must not
blame me for taking my cue from you, who know him
better than I do. I believe, on my soul, you half feared
he was going to marry, and were sorry for it. He is
nothing to you. A woman cannot have two husbands;
that’s bigamy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The doctor was growing irritable, and Josephine
knew it, but she could not forbear answering him
tartly:</p>

<p class='c011'>“There are worse crimes than bigamy,—a great deal,—and
they are none the less worse because the world
does not know of them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What do you mean?” he asked, sharply, and Josephine
replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nothing in particular; only you told me once that
you had broken every commandment except the one
‘Thou shalt do no murder,’ and that you might break
that under strong provocation. Of course there are sins
at your door not generally known. Suppose some one
should be instrumental in bringing them or the worst of
them to light?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then I might break the only commandment you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>say I have not broken,” he answered, and in the eyes
bent so searchingly on Josephine’s face there was an
evil, threatening look, before which she quailed.</p>

<p class='c011'>She must never let him know of the letter hidden
under the carpet, and watched by her so carefully.
Every day she went to the spot to make sure it was
there, and every day she read it again until she knew it
by heart, and had no need to read it except to see if she
had not by some chance made a mistake and read it
wrong. But she had not; the proof was there, of crime,
and guilt, and sin, such as made her terribly afraid of
the man who fondled and caressed her now more than
he had done in weeks, and who at last welcomed Agnes,
when she came, even more warmly than she did herself,
though in not quite so demonstrative a manner.</p>

<p class='c011'>Agnes had gone straight to her sister’s room, which
Josephine had not left since the day she took the foreign
letter from the office and hid it under the carpet. She
had become a monomaniac on the subject of that letter,
and dared not leave lest some one should find it, but sat
all day in her easy-chair, which had been drawn into the
bay window, and stood directly over her secret. And
there she sat when Agnes came in, and then, as if all her
remaining nerves had given way, she threw her arms
around her neck and sobbing out, “Oh, Aggie, I am glad
you have come; I could not have borne it much longer,”
fainted entirely away.</p>

</div>

<div class='c010'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/di_348.jpg' width='100' alt=''>
</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
If there was one thing more than another
which Agnes detested, it was carpet-bugs;
those little black pests which, within a few
years, have crept into the houses in certain
sections of the country, carrying with them
ruin to whatever they fasten upon, and dismay and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>wretchedness to those who will persist in hunting for
them. Among the latter class was Agnes, who, from
the moment the cry of carpet-bugs was raised in Holburton,
had spent half her time upon her hands and knees,
searching for them on the edges of the carpets, and the
rest of her time hunting them in bundles, and boxes, and
drawers. They seemed to owe her a special spite, for
they had eaten her woolen shawl, and her furs, and her
best delaine dress, and life was becoming a burden to
her, when she received Josephine’s letter, begging her to
come at once to the Forrest House.</p>

<p class='c011'>Always ready at a kind word to forgive her sister for
any amount of unkindness, Agnes decided at once to go,
feeling that it would be some comfort to escape from the
dreadful bugs. She did not think they had yet reached
Rothsay; but she meant to make it her first business to
hunt for them, and equipped herself with all the ingredients
named in the category for their extirpation. Persian
powder, red pepper, Scotch snuff, cut tobacco, Paris
green, hellebore, and even Prussic acid formed a portion
of her luggage when she reached the Forrest House, and
found her sister so ill and weak that for a time she had
no thought for carpet-bugs, and had there been an army
there they would have reveled in perfect security for all
of her interference. But after a few days, when Josephine
seemed better and was sleeping quietly, the desire for
research and battle came upon her again, incited by the
softness of the velvet carpet in her sister’s room, which
she thought furnished such a rich field for the marauders.
As it happened, the bay window was the point at which
she commenced operations, as it was farthest from Josephine’s
bed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“They have been here, too,” was her whispered exclamation
as she caught sight of the familiar sign, the
carpet loosened from the floor; and eager in her search
she turned the carpet back farther and farther until she
saw the corner of the letter just protruding in sight. To
draw it out and glance at the name upon it, “J.
Everard Forrest,” was the work of a moment, and then
she wondered how it came there, and if it were some old
thing received by Everard years ago, and left lying
about as something of no interest to him or anybody. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>looked old and worn, and as if it had been read many
times. Surely there could be no harm in her glancing at
the contents just to see if it were of any value.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus reasoning, Agnes opened the letter, saw the
signature and the date, and then with lightning rapidity
read the whole, and Josephine’s secret was hers no
longer, for Agnes had it, and the effect on her at first
was almost as great as it had been on Josephine. That
a great wrong had been committed she was certain, just
as she was certain that the letter was being withheld
from its rightful owner. But by whom? That was the
question she asked herself during the moment she sat
motionless upon the floor, unable to move, or scarcely
think clearly, in her bewildered state of mind. She did
not quite believe it was Josephine, and if not, then it
must be Dr. Matthewson, and he, if the letter were true,
was capable of anything wicked and bad; and there came
over her a great fear of him just as it had crept over
Josephine when she first knew his sin. Agnes must not
let him know what she had found, and, believing Josephine
innocent, she must not disturb her, and add to her
nervousness. Everard, she had heard, was out of town
for a little vacation, which he usually took at that season,
and Miss Belknap was therefore the only person in
whom she could safely confide.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She will know just what to do,” Agnes thought,
and, hiding the letter in her pocket, she arranged the
carpet and curtains very carefully, put the easy-chair in
its place, and was at her sewing by the window when
Josephine awoke, after a sleep of nearly two hours’ duration.</p>

<p class='c011'>She was feeling better, and was disposed to be very
kind and indulgent toward Agnes, who, she saw, was
looking tired and pale.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, Agnes,” she said, “you are almost as white
as I am. What is the matter? You have been shut up
too closely with me. You have not been out since you
came, and you are so accustomed to the air and exercise.
Suppose you go for a walk. I am sure it will do you
good.” Now was Agnes’ opportunity, and saying that
she thought a walk would do her good, she hurried from
the room, and was soon on her way towards Elm Park.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>Beatrice was going to be married, and notwithstanding
what Dr. Matthewson had said of her faded looks,
she had never been so beautiful and sweetly attractive
in her fresh girlhood as she was now at twenty-nine,
with the great happiness shining in her face and showing
itself in every action. Poor, nervous Mollie was
not forgotten, for her memory lived in her lovely children,
Trix and little Bunchie; but Theodore had felt it
right to claim at last his early love, who was not
ashamed to confess how dear he was to her and how glad
she was to be his wife and the mother of his children.</p>

<p class='c011'>The wedding, which was to be very private, was to
take place the 15th of September, now only two weeks
in the distance, and Beatrice was exceedingly busy with
her preparations,—so busy that she had not found time
to call upon Agnes, as she intended to do when she
heard of her arrival at the Forrest House. She had always
liked Agnes, and was glad when her maid came to
her room saying that she was in the parlor waiting to
see her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ask her to come up here,” she said, and in a moment
Agnes was with her, seeming so agitated and excited
that Beatrice guessed at once that something was wrong,
and asked what was the matter.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was not in Agnes’ nature to keep one in suspense,
and she answered by putting the letter into Beatrice’s
hand and saying:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I found it under the carpet, and because I dared
not show it to him,—the doctor, I mean,—who I am sure
put it there, I brought it to you. Read it quick, and
then we must act together; but never let him know I
had a hand in it; he would kill me if he did; there’s
murder in his nature, or he never could have done this.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Agnes was speaking to ears which did not hear what
she was saying, for Bee had taken the letter, postmarked
at “Wien,” and addressed in a handwriting she
knew so well, and the very sight of which made her
heart throb with pain as she remembered the dear little
girl whom she believed to be dead in the far-away foreign
town. But when she glanced at the date, a vague
terror seized her and held her fast while she read the
letter, which I give to the reader:</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>“<span class='sc'>Haelder-Strauchsen</span>, Austria,</div>
      <div class='line in8'>June 10th, 18—.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Everard</span>:—Are you dead? Is everybody
dead in America, that I am forgotten,—deserted,—and
left here alone in this dreadful place? Not dreadful
because they are unkind to me, for they are not. Only
they say that I am mad, and treat me as such, and I always
have an attendant watching what I do, and I cannot
get away, though I have tried so many times.
Where my brother is I do not know; he left me here
more than a year ago, to go to Vienna for a day or two,
he said, and I have never seen him since or heard from
him; and the head of the house,—Dr. Van Schoisner,
says that he is undoubtedly dead; and I might believe
him, perhaps, if he did not insist that I am his niece,
Myra Van Schoisner, and not Rosamond Hastings at all.
He says she died last April, a year ago, and was buried
by the river which I can see from my window, and that
her brother, Dr. Matthewson, left soon after and has not
returned.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, Everard, it is all so dreadful, and sometimes
my head buzzes and feels so big that I am afraid I shall
go crazy, as they say I am. I have written and written
to you and Bee and Lawyer Russell, and even to my
brother, hoping he might be living; but no answer has
come, and now I do not think my letters ever left this
<i><span lang="fr">Maison de Sante</span></i>, as they call the institution, which
stands several miles back from the Danube. Take the
boat at Lintz, and get off at ——, and come quick, and
get me away from here before I die. I wonder I have
not died before this, it is so awful to be shut up and
called somebody else, and hear only a foreign language,
of which at first I could not understand a word, and
they tried not to let me learn. Only the doctor speaks
English, and a woman called Yulah Van Eisner, who
came as attendant two months ago, and who has promised
to get this letter off for me.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I spoke brother’s name to her,—Dr. Matthewson,—and
she almost foamed at the mouth, and actually spit
upon me because I was his sister; but I made her know I
was good, made her listen to me; and she became my
friend, and taught me to speak with her, and will help
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>me to get away if she can. She says my brother is not
dead; he is a villain, and wants my money; and that
Myra Van Schoisner is in the grave where they say I am;
and it’s all horrible, and I am so sick and frightened, and
so afraid I shall be mad if you don’t come quick.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dear, dear Everard, come to your poor</p>
<div class='lg-container-r c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span class='sc'>Rossie</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>This was all Rossie had written, but a postscript had
been added, in a cramped, uneducated hand, and broken
English, to this effect:</p>

<p class='c013'>“I open this paper to tell when comes come to Hotel
<em>Rother Krebs</em>, in Lintz, where I is work <i><span lang="de">zu hause</span></i>, and
wait for <i><span lang="de">die Amerikaner</span></i>. Asks for Yulah Van Eisner.
I hates him much.”</p>

<p class='c011'>To say that Beatrice’s nerves were shaken by this letter
would be putting in very mild language just how
she felt. With her usual quickness of perception, she
saw and understood the diabolical plot which had been
so long successful, and her first impulse was to rush
through the streets of Rothsay, and, proclaiming the
doctor’s perfidy, have him arrested at once. Her next
and soberer thought was to proceed in the matter more
quietly and surely, and to this end she questioned Agnes
minutely as to where and how she found the letter, and if
she could throw any light upon the way in which it came
there. But Agnes could not; she only knew she had found
it, and that she believed Dr. Matthewson himself had by
some foul method obtained possession of it and hidden
it away for safe keeping, though why he had not destroyed
it and so made its discovery impossible, neither
she nor Beatrice could guess. Her sister, she said, was
in a very strange, nervous state of mind, but she could
not connect her with the crime in any way, for, unscrupulous
as she might be, she would not dare make herself
amenable to the law by being a party to her husband’s
guilt.</p>

<p class='c011'>This was Agnes’ view of the matter, and Beatrice
coincided with her, but bade her to be very watchful
at the Forrest House and see if any search was made for
the missing letter, and by whom.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>Beatrice’s next interview was with Lawyer Russell,
who, in his surprise, bounded from his chair half-way
across the room as he exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Lord bless my soul, Rossie alive! Rossie not dead!
but hid away in a private mad-house! It’s the most
hellish plot I ever heard of,—ever,—and it is State
prison for <em>him</em>, the villain; but we must move cautiously,
Miss Belknap, very cautiously, as we have the very
Old Nick to deal with in that doctor. I’m glad the boy
is gone just now, as it would have been like you to have
blated it out to him, and then all creation couldn’t have
stopped him from throttling the wretch in the street and
spoiling everything. This letter was written long ago,
and there’s no knowing what may have happened since
to our little girl. She may be dead sure enough now,
or, what is worse, mad in real earnest. So don’t go to
kicking up a row just yet, till we get more proof, and
then we’ll spring the trap so tight that he cannot get
away. I’m honestly afraid, though, that he has done
something worse with the little girl since he had this
letter, which the Lord only knows how he got. He must
have a key to Everard’s drawer; but we’ll fix him! and,
Miss Belknap, I say, you or somebody must go to Europe
and hunt up poor little Rossie. I’ll be hanged if it don’t
make me cry to think of her shut up, and waiting and
waiting for us to come. Go on your wedding trip. You
and the parson will do better than Everard, whose name
they have heard, and for whom they may be on the
watch. Morton is new to them, and will excite no suspicion.
This girl,—what’s her name,—Yulah Van Eisner,
must be found first, of course, if she is not already put
out of the way, and with her help you’ll fetch her, poor
little girl. You ought to go right away, and we’ll say
nothing to Everard till you’ve found her. Suspense and
then disappointment would kill him outright. And <em>he</em>
must not go; that hound would track him sure, and
everything be spoiled. You must do it, and you can,
better than anybody else.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Beatrice felt that she could too, and had rapidly
concocted in her mind a denouement both startling and
novel, and highly satisfactory. But there was one difficulty
to be surmounted. Theodore’s people might not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>be willing for him to be gone so long, and in that case
she said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll postpone the wedding and go alone.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But this was not necessary, for, in response to the
long letter which went that night to Boston, there
came a telegram, “I can go!” and then all Bee’s
thoughts were turned to the work she had on hand,
and she grew so restless and nervous and impatient for
the day when she could start that people noted and
commented upon her changed looks and manner, wondering
greatly what ailed her, and if her heart were
not in the marriage.</p>

<p class='c011'>Everard was in Rothsay now, and with her every
evening, talking always of Rossie, whose grave he bade
her be sure and find, and bring him something from it,
if only a blade of grass. Once he startled her by saying
he had half made up his mind to join her party, and go
with her, so great was his desire to see where Rossie
was buried. But Bee turned upon him so fiercely, declaring
that she preferred going alone with Theo, that
he abandoned the plan altogether, and felt a little hurt
at the vehemence with which his company had been
rejected.</p>

<p class='c011'>The wedding was very quiet and small, and the bride
very absent-minded and non-committal in her answers
to their inquiries as to where she was going, and how
long she expected to be gone. But whatever they
might have thought of her, the bridegroom was perfectly
satisfied, and seemed supremely happy as he bade
his friends good-by, and followed his impatient wife into
the car which was to take them to New York, and the
ship, which, on the 15th of September, sailed away for
Europe, where they hoped to find poor Rossie.</p>

<p class='c011'>Agnes was at the wedding, and, with the exception
of Lawyer Russell, was the only one who had the slightest
suspicion of the reason which had taken the newly-wedded
pair so suddenly to Europe. But Agnes was
safe as the grave, though often at her wits’ end to know
what to make of her sister, who grew worse instead of
better, and who sometimes talked and acted as if she
had lost her reason. She had missed the letter from its
hiding-place, and gone nearly wild in her excitement and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>anxiety as to who had found it. But as her husband’s
manner was unchanged, except as he fretted at her continued
illness, she gradually grew more quiet, though
there was constantly with her a presentiment of some
great evil which was to be brought about by means of
the lost letter.</p>

Just where it was situated, how far from
Vienna, how far from Lintz, or how far from
the Danube, does not matter to the reader,
who needs only to know that there was such
a place, embowered in trees, and flowers, and
shrubs, and seeming to the casual passer-by like a second
little Eden, where one had nothing to do but to enjoy
the brightness of the Austrian skies, and the beauty of
the premises around. But every door was barred, and
every window had a net-work of iron in front of it,
through which white, haggard faces looked wistfully, and
strange, wild laughs, mingled sometimes with cries of
rage, were heard to issue at all hours of the day. Frequently
the inmates of that house, or those who were on
the “good list,” walked in the beautiful grounds, but
never walked alone. An attendant was always with
them, watchful, vigilant, without, however, seeming to
be so; for the rule of the house was kindness, whenever
it would answer, and as much freedom as was compatible
with safety. Except in extreme cases, where the patient
was poor and obscure, it was not a cruelly conducted
household which Baron or Doctor Van Schoisner had in
charge; but in all the world there was not, perhaps, a
more avaricious, grasping man than the baron, who would
have sold his soul for thirty pieces of silver, and for
forty almost have consented to a murder. If, for purposes
of their own, people wished to incarcerate their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>friends, and paid him well for it, their secret was safe
with him, and the victim was insane as long as he lived,
if necessary. But there his wickedness ceased, and his
patients were generally made as happy and comfortable
as it was possible to make them. He, alone, held the
secrets of his employers. Not a whisper of the truth
ever escaped his lips, and to his attendants everybody
was crazy, and must be watched and treated as such, no
matter what were their pretensions to the contrary; so
when poor little Rossie awoke one morning to find herself
deserted, she became at once a <em>lunatic</em>. All liberty
of action was gone; even her name was taken from her,
and she was told that the Rosamond Hastings who she
professed to be, was dead, and lying under the grass
where the wild violets were growing, while she was
<em>Myra</em>, the niece of the baron, who had come to the
house the same night with the beautiful American girl
who was so sick, and who had died in a few days. No
wonder if for a time her brain reeled, and she was in
danger of being in reality insane.</p>

<p class='c011'>Poor little Rossie had enjoyed much and suffered
much since the day when we last saw her, waving a
farewell to her friends from the deck of the steamer
which bore her away. Her brother had been uniformly
kind and affectionate to her, but many things had arisen
to shake her confidence in him, and to make her think it
possible that he was not the honorable, upright man he
professed to be. Then, as the year wore on, and they
got farther and farther from home, her letters were
unanswered, and there began to steal over her a longing
for America which she could not conceal, and
which took all the color from her face and roundness
from her form, until at last she was really sick with hope
deferred and an anxiety to know why none of her letters
were answered.</p>

<p class='c011'>At Florence she was very ill of a fever contracted in
Rome, and from the effects of which she did not recover,
although she was able at last to go on toward Vienna,
their ultimate destination. At Salzburg they halted for
a few days, and there her brother brought to her a
stranger, whom he introduced as a friend and old acquaintance,
Dr. Van Schoisner, to whom he said he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>owed his life, and who had a kind of Sanitarium for
people diseased in body and mind, upon the river Danube.
Van Schoisner, who spoke English very well, was
exceedingly kind and tender in his manner toward Rossie,
whom he questioned so closely, and in such a peculiar
way, that she first was annoyed, and then confused
and bewildered, and finally contradicted herself two or
three times in her statements with regard to her recent
illness, and when he asked how she would like to go to
his beautiful place on the river and stay a few weeks
while he treated her, she shrank away from him, and
bursting into tears said she would not like it at all,—that
she did not need to be treated, as there was nothing the
matter with her but homesickness, and only America
could cure that.</p>

<p class='c011'>Van Schoisner laughed, and stroked her hair, and
said he would soon have her all right, and then went to
her brother, between whom and himself there was a
long conference, during which both sold themselves,
body and soul, to the evil one, and were pledged to do
his work.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If she would only abandon that nonsense of hers
about giving her fortune to that Forrest, as soon as she
comes of age, and would share it with me, I wouldn’t do
it, for, by Jove, I’ve a kind of liking for the girl,” Dr.
Matthewson said, as there came a little prick of conscience,
and a drawing back from the thing he proposed to
do, which was nothing more or less than burying Rossie
alive inside a mad-house, where, so long as the price was
paid, she would be as really dead to the world as if the
grass were growing over her, and where the chances
were that she would either die a speedy death, or, with
her temperament, become a hopeless lunatic.</p>

<p class='c011'>Money he must have, and as he believed in neither
God nor the devil, he had no scruples as to how he got
it, only he would a little rather not murder one outright
to get it. Every argument which he could think of had
been brought to bear upon Rossie, with a view to inducing
here to keep the fortune willed her, but she had
stood firm as a rock in her decision to make the whole
over to Everard as soon as she came of age, and so he had
recourse to the horrid scheme of which we have hinted.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>He knew Van Schoisner well, and knew that he was
the man for any deed, however dark,—provided there
was money in it, with little chance of detection; and he
sent for him to meet them at Salzburg to confer on important
business. So Van Schoisner went and found
what the business was, and talked to Rossie about her
head, and brain, and <em>cerebellum</em>, until she lost her wits
and said she hadn’t any <em>cerebellum</em>, and never had. She
was homesick, and that was all. This, of course, was
proof conclusive of a diseased state of mind. A girl
who hadn’t any cerebellum, and who persisted in throwing
away hundreds of thousands of dollars, must be insane
and dealt with accordingly. So the bargain was made,
and Rossie’s fate was sealed. And then arose the question
of the friends at home. What should be said to
them to quiet all suspicion?</p>

<p class='c011'>“She must be dead, of course,” Van Schoisner said.
“Nothing easier than that. A notice in the paper; a
letter containing particulars; crape on your hat; a
tear in your eye, and the thing is accomplished.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” returned the doctor, “but suppose that chap
who is in love with her takes it into his head to come
spooning after her grave, and inquires about her death,
and wants to see the very room, and all that,—and it
would be like him to do it,—what then?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Van Schoisner rubbed his forehead thoughtfully a
moment, and then said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s the hardest part to manage, but I think I
can do it, only give me time. I have a niece in the
country a few miles from here, very sick with consumption,—in
the last stages, and poor, too, with no friends
but myself. I pay her board where she is, and visit her
sometimes. She was born in London, her father was an
Englishman; so she speaks English perfectly, and might
be your sister. I have talked of taking her to Haelder-Strauchsen,
and will do so at once, though the journey
will shorten her life. But that will not matter, as she
must die soon. Once at Haelder-Strauchsen she is your
sister, and your sister is my niece. The attendants
never ask questions nor talk. Do you comprehend?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Dr. Matthewson thought he did, but left the matter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>wholly to his ally, who had, if possible, drank deeper
from the cup of iniquity than himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>As the result of this conversation there was brought
to the hotel a few days later a white-faced, fair-haired
girl, in whose great blue eyes and about whose mouth
and nose death was plainly written. They called her
Myra, and said she was Van Schoisner’s niece, whom
he was taking to his home for better care than she could
have in the country. No one attended her. Her uncle
could do all that was necessary, he said, and he seemed
very kind to her, and staid by her constantly upon the
boat when at last they started for home, accompanied
by Dr. Matthewson and Rossie, who was greatly interested
in the sick girl. It was night when they
reached the landing where they were to stop, and from
the windows of the close carriage Rossie saw nothing
of the country through which they passed for a few
miles, but was conscious at last that they were entering
spacious grounds, and stopping before a large, square
building, with two wings on either side.</p>

<p class='c011'>The room assigned her was in one of the wings on
the third floor, as was Myra’s also. It was very prettily
furnished, and the windows looked out upon the grounds,
but there was stretched before them a gauzy net-work
of iron, which Rossie noticed at once, and asked for the
reason. Then her brother explained to her the real
character of the house, but said that as they were transient
visitors it would not affect them in the least, and
all she had to do was to rest and get as well as possible,
so they might go on to Vienna.</p>

<p class='c011'>And Rossie tried to rest and enjoy the beautiful
place, but the occasional sight of some of the patients
walking in the distance, the strange sounds, like human
cries, which reached her in the night when everything
was still, and, more than all, a great languor and desire
to sleep which she could not shake off, wore upon her
so fast that in a few days she was seriously ill again,
and lost all consciousness of time or what was passing
around her. How long she remained in this condition
she never knew; only this, that she awoke one morning
to find Van Schoisner with her, apparently watching her
as she slept, and administering some powerful stimulants.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>He was very kind, indeed, and told her Dr. Matthewson
had been obliged to go to Vienna on business, which
might detain him a few days, but he would soon be back,
and she was to be as happy and quiet as possible till his
return. Her next question was for the sick girl, who, he
said, had died a week ago, and then he bade her try to
sleep again, as perfect rest was what she needed most.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And I went to sleep,” Rossie said, afterward, when
telling Beatrice of that awful time when she was kept a
prisoner at Haelder-Strauchsen, with no hope of escape.
“I went to sleep and slept so heavily and long that it
must have been days before I awoke, and when I did,
my head ached so hard, and everything seemed so confused,
and I could not understand a word the woman
said, for she spoke only German, which I never could
make out. I tried to make her know that I wanted my
brother, but she shook her head and put her finger to her
lips, and finally went out and locked the door after her.
Then I got up and went to the window, and leaned my
head against the bars, and cried for home, and you, and
Everard, till I felt so sick and dizzy that I went back to
bed, and lay there till Van Schoisner came and told me
nothing had been heard from Dr. Matthewson since he
left the Sanitarium, two weeks before.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘I certainly expected him to return,’ he said, ‘and
am afraid some evil has befallen him. I have written to
the hotel where he intended to stop, and they have not
seen him.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“He called him Dr. Matthewson all the time, as
formal-like as if he had not been my brother, and once
he called me <em>Myra</em>, and when I said he was mistaken, for I
was Rossie Hastings, he smiled kind of pityingly, and said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Poor little girl, be anything you like to yourself.
To me you are Myra. Rossie died just across the hall,
and is buried in such a pretty spot.’</p>

<p class='c011'>“I thought he was crazy, and felt afraid of him, but
had no suspicion then of the real state of things. That
came gradually, as days and weeks went by and I heard
nothing from my brother, and seldom saw any one but
the doctor and the attendant, Margotte, who never talked
with me except by signs, so I had no opportunity to learn
the language, which I greatly desired to do, in order to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>make myself understood, and convince her that I was not
Myra, and was not mad, as I knew she believed me to be.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, it was so horrible that time, and my head got
so confused, and I used to pray constantly ‘God keep
me from going really mad!’ and he did, though I was
very near it. At first they would not let me have paper
or ink to write to you with, but I begged so hard on my
knees, clinging to that man’s feet, that he consented at
last, and I wrote to you, and Everard, and Lawyer Russell,
and my brother, too, though I did not know where
he was, and Margotte took the letters, which I know
now were never sent, but were burned to ashes, for
Yulah told me so,—good, kind Yulah, who came to me
like an angel from Heaven.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Margotte was sick, and Yulah took her place. She
had been there once as a patient, mad herself, from some
great wrong done to her by one she loved and trusted.
Her baby had died there, and been buried in the grounds,
and she was attached to the place, and after her cure,
staid from choice, and was nurse and attendant both,
and the most faithful and vigilant of them all, and the one
the doctor trusted the most. So he put me in her charge,
and the moment I saw her sweet, sad face, and looked
into her eyes, which seemed always ready to run over
with tears, I loved her, and put my tired head in her
lap, and cried like a child.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘<i><span lang="fr">Qu’avez vous, petite Myra?</span></i>’ she said, and then I
knew she spoke French, and my heart gave a great
bound, for I knew I could talk with her a little, and I
mustered all my knowledge of the language and told her
I was not Myra at all; I was Rosamond Hastings, from
America; shut up, detained there unlawfully, for what
reason I did not know; that I had written and written
home and nobody had answered me, and the doctor said
my brother, who came with me, was dead, but I did not
believe it; and a great deal more, to which she listened
patiently, as one might listen to the meaningless prattle
of a child.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But when I mentioned brother’s name, she sprang
to her feet and shaking me off asked fiercely, ‘<i><span lang="fr">votre frère,
comment s’appelle-t-il?</span></i>’ I told her again, ‘Dr. Matthewson;
Dr. John Matthewson, from America,’ and for a few
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>moments she acted as if she were perfectly insane, and
glaring at me with her terrible eyes, she spit upon me
and demanded, ‘You are sure you are his sister? You
are nothing else to him, though that is bad enough?’</p>

<p class='c011'>“I made her believe at last, and then she asked me
so many questions that before I knew it I had told her
all about the Forrest House, and the will, and Everard,
and everything, she all the time looking straight at me
with her great bright eyes, which seemed to be reading
me to see if I were telling the truth.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘I see, I see, I understand. Poor child, God sent
me here to be your friend, and I will!’ she said, when I
had finished; and then she broke out angrily against my
brother, whom she called a villain, a murderer, a rascal,
and said he had done her a terrible wrong, which she had
sworn to avenge, and she saw a way by which she could
keep her word.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘I go to America myself, but what your friends
shall know,’ she said, and to my great delight she spoke
to me now in English, but whispered very low. ‘It is
better they not to know I can talk in your tongue, and
they not suspect; and I must be very strict, watch you
very much is my order, because you dangerous, you try
to kill yourself, he say, and I never let you from my
sight. But I fix ’em. I cheat. I have my revenge
much. You will see what I do.’”</p>

<p class='c011'>This was in part the story told afterwards to Beatrice
by Rossie, who did not then know that Yulah Van
Eisner was the girl who had once pleaded so piteously
for justice at the hands of Dr. Matthewson, and been by
him spurned with contempt, which had turned her love
into bitter hatred. She saw no reason to discredit Rossie’s
story, and understood readily why she had been
immured in a living tomb, and guessed that to her friends
at home she was supposed to be dead, and that the
knavish brother had the inheritance. She did not, however,
communicate all her suspicions to her charge, as
she did not wish to wound her unnecessarily, but she
meant to get her away, and set herself steadily to that
object. Through her influence writing materials were
again furnished to Rossie, who, acting upon Yulah’s
advice, wrote two letters to Everard, one of which went
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>into Von Schoisner’s hands and was burned as usual,
while the other was secreted about Yulah’s person and
found its way to America, but not until some time had
elapsed, and Yulah had given up her situation to Margotte,
with the understanding, however, that there was
always a place for her in the Maison de Sante, either as
attendant or nurse, when she chose to return.</p>

There were not as many visitors as usual that
season in Lintz, and those who did come were
mostly English or French, who did not spend
their money as freely as the Americans were
accustomed to do, so that it was a matter of
rejoicing to the master of the Rother Krebs when one
afternoon in October the stage brought from the station
two passengers whom, with his quick eye, he set down
as Americans, and bustled out to meet them, deciding
that they were people who would not stand for a few
thalers more or less. Beatrice was very tired, for they
had not stopped at all since landing in Liverpool, but had
crossed at once to the Continent, and traveled day and
night until they reached Lintz, where Yulah was waiting
for them. She had sought and obtained the situation as
chambermaid in the hotel, and, like the master, had
watched impatiently for Americans, though from a very
different reason. And when <em>her</em> Americans came, she
knew them as if by instinct, taking Mr. Morton, however,
for Everard, and feeling greatly disappointed when
she learned that it was a Mr. and Mrs. Morton, who were
occupying No. —, the great room in the house where
princes had dined and slept. Still, something told her
that Beatrice was the lady she was looking for, and when
the latter retired to her room after dinner she found a
sad-faced woman pretending to be busy with something
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>about the washstand, though everything seemed in its
place. Suddenly she faced about, and the eyes of the
two women met and looked into each other with an
eager, questioning gaze.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are Yulah,” Beatrice said, in German, and the
girl answered with a cry of joy, “Yes, and you are the
Lady Beatrice she talks so much about, and he is not
Mr. Everard.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, my husband, Mr. Morton. We were married
just before we sailed. Where is she? When did you
see her last, and how soon can we have her? Will
they let her go without any trouble, and what are we
to do?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Beatrice asked her questions so rapidly as to confuse
and bewilder the girl, who shook her head, and answered
in English:</p>

<p class='c011'>“You ask so many, I don’t know quite all. But I
go to-morrow and tell her, and see how we can do best.
He will never let her go, there is too much money in her.
That doctor pay big sums. We must take her, that’s all,
and be so careful. You stay here till I come or send
some word: not to-morrow, but next day, perhaps. I
not talk more now. I be at my duties.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She left the room then, and Beatrice saw no more
of her until the day but one following, when about dark
she came into the room, flushed and excited, and evidently
a little shaken out of her usual quiet, composed
manner. She had been to Haelder-Strauchsen; she had
seen Rossie, but had not told her of her friends’ arrival.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I did not dare,” she said, “she’s so weak and sick,
no heart, no courage, but stands by the window all the
day, looking to the west, and whispering, sometimes,
‘Oh, Everard, why do you not come, and I waiting so
long?’ But we’ll get her sure. God fixed it for us, and
he,—the doctor, I mean,—is awful with something they
think is cholera, and all is fright and confusion, for the
nurses is afraid and leaving, and Miss Rossie’s attendant
is glad to have me take her place. So I am going back
to-morrow, and you must go with me and stay in the
town a mile away, until I send or bring you word what
you do next. You are not afraid of cholera? Americans
mostly is.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>Bee <em>was</em> mortally afraid of it, but she would have
faced death itself for the sake of recovering Rossie, and
it was arranged that they should take the boat the next
day for the little town near the <i><span lang="fr">Maison de Sante</span></i>, where
Yulah told them there was a comfortable inn, where they
could remain in quiet as long as they liked. Travelers,
especially Americans, often stopped there, she said, and
their being there would awaken no suspicion. Accordingly,
the next afternoon found them occupants of a
pleasant chamber in the inn, with an outlook to the river
and another to the road which led out to <i><span lang="fr">La Maison de
Sante</span></i>. Yulah had come with them on the boat as a second-class
passenger, and had held no communication whatever
with them, lest suspicion might in some way be
aroused; and immediately after landing had taken the
road to the Sanitarium, while Beatrice tried in vain to
keep composed and quiet, and await the turn of events.
That she should actually see Rossie that night she could
not realize, and when about dark a note was brought her
by a little boy, her limbs trembled so violently, and she
felt so faint and giddy, as to be scarcely able to read it.</p>

<p class='c011'>The note was as follows:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Have a big carriage at the south gate, one little
ways off, at eleven to-night. Get Michel Fahen,—he my
friend; this his little boy; he keep the carriages.”</p>

<p class='c011'>That seemed to bring Rossie very near, and Bee’s
face was white as ashes as she questioned the boy, who
said Michael Fahen was his father, and rented carriages
to people, and if she liked he would bring him to the
room. Michel was a powerfully-built man, who looked
as if he could keep a whole army at bay by the sheer
strength of his fists, and when told what was wanted of
him, or rather that he was to wait with them near the
south gate of the <i><span lang="fr">Maison de Sante</span></i> at eleven that night,
shot at them a keen, quick glance of intelligence and
comprehension which made Beatrice sick with fear, lest,
after all, they should fail. But his words and manner
were reassuring. He could guess what they wanted, and
he was the man to do it. He did not believe in the
place; there were many there who ought to be out.
Yes, he’d help her; he’d drive them to Vienna, if necessary;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>he knew the south gate, in the rear of the house,
opening on a lonesome and unfrequented road.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And I shall succeed,” he said. “Michel Fahen
never fails; arms strong, horses fleet, and Yulah cunning
as the very ——.”</p>

<p class='c011'>His confidence in himself inspired them with confidence
in him, and at the time appointed they were in his
carriage, and entering the narrow road which lay to the
rear of the <i><span lang="fr">Maison de Sante</span></i>, and more than a quarter of
a mile distant. That portion of the grounds was filled
with trees and shrubbery, and was not often used either
for convenience or pleasure by the inmates of the house,
the chimneys of which were by daylight just perceptible
through the tall, thick trees.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bee could see nothing in the darkness except the
occasional glimmer of a light moving from point to point,
as she sat, half-fainting with nervous fear and impatience,
while the clock in the tower told first the hour of eleven,
and then the quarter, and then the half, and then,—surely
there was a footstep in the direction of the gate,
and a voice she recognized as Yulah’s called softly,
“Michel, Michel, are you there? Help me lift her; she
is dead, or fainted, and I’ve brought her all the way.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Can one of you hold my horses?” Michel asked, and
in an instant Beatrice was at their heads, patting, and
caressing, and talking to them in the language all brutes
recognize, whether in English or German, while Mr.
Morton and Michel were at the gate, which was high
and locked, and over which they lifted bodily a figure
which lay perfectly motionless in the arms of Michel,
who bore it to the carriage, and laid it down gently, but
not until Beatrice, with a woman’s forethought, had made
sure who it was.</p>

<p class='c011'>She had risked too much to be disappointed now, and
bidding Michel wait a moment, she struck a match with
which she had prepared herself, and holding it close to
the inanimate form in his arms, saw the face she knew,
but so white, and worn, and still, with the long, curling
lashes lasting on the pallid cheeks, where tears and suffering
had left their traces in dark, purplish rings, that
with a gasping cry she said: “Oh, Theo, it’s Rossie,
but dead; I am sure she is dead.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>“Now, Michel, drive for your life!” Yulah exclaimed,
as she sprang to the box beside him, after having seen
Rossie carefully lifted into the carriage, where she lay
supported mostly by Mr. Morton, though her head was
in Beatrice’s lap, and Beatrice’s hands were busy unfastening
the waterproof hood, and her tears were flowing
like rain on the face which, even in the darkness, looked
ghostly white and corpse-like.</p>

<p class='c011'>The manner of escape had been as follows: The doctor
had died that afternoon, and as his disease had undoubtedly
been cholera in its most malignant form,
great consternation had prevailed in the building among
the employees, some of whom had left, and most of
whom kept as far as possible from the wing where he
had died, and where Rossie’s room was situated. Yulah
alone was fearless, and came and went as usual, in her
capacity of attendant in place of Margotte, who had fled
to the town. To prevent contagion, it was thought best
to bury the body at midnight, with as little ceremony as
possible, and thus everything was in confusion, of which
Yulah took advantage. She was very popular in the
house, and when she asked permission to go out for the
evening and take one of the nurses with her, it was readily
granted her, with the injunction that she should wait until
her patient was asleep, or at least quiet for the night.
To this she readily assented, saying that she would lock
her in the room so as to prevent the possibility of her
venturing into the hall while the body was being removed.
This arranged, her next business was to prepare
Rossie, who had recently sunk into a state of despondency
amounting almost to insanity itself, and who spent
most of her time sitting or standing by the window, with
her face toward the setting sun, and such a hopeless,
weary expression upon it as was very touching to see.
She was standing thus, although it was already too dark
to see more than the lights in the distant town, when
Yulah came hurriedly in, and, bolting the door, went up
to her and said, in broken English:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Cheer up, petite, joy and glad at last. They are
come; they here for you!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not Everard! Oh, has he come?” and a low cry
broke from Rossie’s quivering lips.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>But Yulah stifled it at once by putting her hand
over her mouth, and saying:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Careful, much careful. They must not hear. I fix
it for you, and you be still and listen.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Very rapidly she told her that Mrs. Morton and her
husband, whom she called anything but Morton, were at
the inn waiting for them, and detailed her plan of escape,
to which Rossie listened in a kind of apathetic way,
which showed that she did not clearly comprehend what
was meant, or who was waiting for her. Certainly she
never thought of Beatrice, but she understood that
all she had to do was to obey orders, and taking the seat
which Yulah bade her take, she sat as immovable as a
stone, with her great, black eyes following every movement
of her nurse, who, alarmed at last at their expression
and the rigid attitude of the figure, which scarcely
seemed to breathe, tried to rouse her to something like
sense and feeling, but all in vain.</p>

<p class='c011'>One idea and one alone had possession of Rossie. If
she would escape she must be <em>still</em>, and she sometimes
held her breath lest she should be heard by the men,
who, at the far end of the long hall, were passing in and
out of the room where the dead body lay. No one came
near No. —, or paid any attention when, about half-past
ten, two female figures emerged from the door,—one
wrapped in a blue waterproof, with the hood drawn
closely over the face; the other unmistakably Yulah,
who, locking the door behind her and putting the key in
her pocket, hurried with her companion down the two
long flights of stairs, and through a back, winding piazza,
to the rear of the house, where the door she had unfastened
an hour before stood partly open, and through
which she went, dragging her companion after her. It
was literally dragging until the safety of the thick
shrubbery was reached, when Rossie gave out and
sank down at Yulah’s feet unconscious, and fainted entirely
away. To add to Yulah’s alarm, there was a
sound of footsteps near. Somebody was in the
wood besides herself, and she waited breathlessly until
the sound ceased in the distance, as the person or persons,
for there seemed to be two, hurried on. Then,
taking Rossie in her arms, she made what progress she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>could, groping through the dark and underbrush, as she
dared not keep to the path. But the gate was reached
at last, and with Michel’s strong hands to help, Rossie
was lifted over it and into the carriage, which was driven
rapidly in the direction of the nearest railway station.</p>

Three weeks after the events recorded in the
last chapter, the <em>City of Berlin</em> came slowly
up the New York harbor, and of all the eager,
expectant faces in the crowd of people upon
the deck, none was happier or more eager
than that of Beatrice, who, now that her work was accomplished,
and Rossie safe in her possession, had given herself
up to the pleasures of her honeymoon, and been the
merriest, happiest, most loving of brides, during all the
voyage, except when she looked at the white-faced girl
who lay in her berth so quietly, or sat so still in her
chair on deck, looking out upon the sea with eyes which
did not seem to see anything or take note of what was
passing.</p>

<p class='c011'>The flight from Haelder-Strauchsen to the nearest
railroad had been accomplished in safety, and there they
waited a few hours for the arrival of the train, which
was to take them away from the scene of so much
danger. And here it was that Beatrice suggested to
Yulah that she go with them to America, either as Rossie’s
maid or her own.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I mean to do it all the time, then I see what come
to he,—the villain,—and I take much care my poor little
one, who so tired and scared in her head, but who come
right sure when the boy Everard is near,” Yulah said, as
she stroked the thin, hot hands, folded so helplessly
across Rossie’s breast.</p>

<p class='c011'>Very rapidly she communicated her intention to Michel,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>telling him at the same time the full particulars of Rossie’s
incarceration in the <i><span lang="fr">Maison de Sante</span></i>, and bidding him repeat
it in Haelder-Strauchsen, if there was a great stir on
account of the abduction. Mr. Morton had paid his bills
at the inn, and said that he should not return, as he was
going to a point higher up the river, so no suspicions
could be awakened there of anything wrong until the
alarm was given at the house. And this, in all human
probability, would not be till late the next morning,
when, as Yulah failed to appear, inquiries might be
made, and the door of No. — be forced open, and by
that time the fugitives would be miles and miles away,
speeding on toward the west, and Michel Fahen would
be smoking his pipe very unconcernedly at the door of
his kitchen, knowing nothing whatever of any escaped
lunatic, or of Yulah Van Eisner’s whereabouts; knowing
nothing, except that he carried some English-talking
people to a railroad station, and was rewarded for it by
many, many <i><span lang="fr">thalers</span></i>. So, of whatever commotion or excitement
there was, Mr. and Mrs. Morton were ignorant,
and kept rapidly on their way until the continent was
crossed, and they felt safe in the seclusion of crowded
London. Here they rested in lodgings a few days, and
called the best medical advice for Rossie, who, since recovering
from the dead faint in which she had been more
than an hour, had been just on the border land, where
her reason seemed hesitating whether to go or stay.
When it first came to her in the carriage who it was bending
so lovingly over her, she had burst into a wild fit of
weeping, which frightened them more than the faint had
done. Her first words, when she did speak, were:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Everard, where are you? hold my hand in yours
and I shall not be afraid.”</p>

<p class='c011'>At a sign from his wife, Mr. Morton took Rossie’s
hand in his and held it, while Bee whispered to her,
“Don’t talk now, darling. It is all right. We are
going home.”</p>

<p class='c011'>How much Rossie realized of that rapid journey,
which was continued day and night, they could not guess,
for she never spoke again or showed any sign that she
understood what was passing around her, except to
answer their questions in monosyllables and smile so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>sweetly and trustfully in their faces when they told her,
as they often did, that she was safe, until London was
reached, and they laid her in the clean, sweet bed in the
large, airy room in quiet Kensington, where they had
taken lodgings.</p>

<p class='c011'>For several days they staid in London, and then took
passage for home in the <em>City of Berlin</em>, where everything
was done to make the voyage comfortable and easy for
Rossie, who talked but little, and who, when she did
speak, always asked, “How long before I shall see
Everard?”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was only the <i><span lang="fr">Maison de Sante</span></i> and the incidents
connected with it which had any power to excite or even
interest her. With regard to everything else, except
Everard, she was silent and indifferent, asking no questions,
and even taking Beatrice’s marriage as a matter of
course, and never offering a comment upon it. But
when at last America was in sight and they were coming
up the harbor, she roused from her apathy and went up
on deck with the others, and sat in her chair, with a
bright flush on her cheeks and a sparkle in her eyes which
made them as bright as stars. She was looking for
Everard, and trying to make him out in the group of
men waiting on the distant wharf for the boat.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I must tell her,” Bee thought; and sitting down beside
her, she said: “Darling, I know you expect Everard
to meet you, but he is not here. He did not even
know we were going for you, and we would not tell him
for fear we might fail, and then he would feel worse
than ever. But he is in Rothsay, and will be so glad to
get his dear little girl once more. Don’t cry,” she
added, as the great tears gathered in Rossie’s eyes and
rolled down her cheeks. “We meant it for the best, and
you shall see him soon, very soon. We will go on
to-night, if you think you can bear it. Are you strong
enough?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, go on,—quick,—fast, just as we came through
Europe. I want to see Everard,” Rossie whispered, and
so they went on that night in the express which left for
Pittsburg, from which city a telegram was forwarded to
Lawyer Russell, to the effect that Mr. and Mrs. Morton
would be in Rothsay on the late train.</p>

<div class='c010'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/di_373.jpg' width='100' alt=''>
</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
A wild storm was sweeping over Southern
Ohio that November night, and nowhere was
it wilder or more violent than in Rothsay,
where the rain fell in torrents, and ere it
reached the ground was taken up by the
wind and driven in blinding sheets through the deserted
streets. But wild as the storm was in the village, it
seemed wilder still in the vicinity of the Forrest House,
which fairly shook on its solid foundations with the
force of the tempest. Tree after tree was blown down,
shrubs were uprooted, and the fanciful summer-house
which the doctor had erected on the spot where Rossie
used to tend and water her geraniums and fuchsias, went
crashing down, a heap of ruins, while within, in the most
costly and elegant chamber, a fiercer storm was raging
between a soul trying to free itself from its prison walls
of clay and the body which struggled so hard to retain
it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Josephine had not improved, as at one time it was
thought she might. The secret which she held and the
loss of the letter had worn upon her terribly, and the
constant dread of some impending evil had produced a
kind of brain fever, and for days her life had been in
imminent danger, and the doctor had staid by her constantly,
marveling at the strangeness of her talk, and
wondering sometimes if it were possible that she could
have become possessed of the secret which at times filled
even him with horror and a haunting fear of what might
come upon him should his guilt be known. But Josephine
could have no knowledge of his crime. Van
Schoisner was safe as the grave so long as the money was
paid, as it would continue to be, for he had set aside a
certain amount, the interest of which went regularly to
Haelder-Strauchsen, and would go so long as Rossie lived.
This, in all human probability, would not be long, for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>Von Schoisner wrote of her failing health, and told how
bewildered she was growing in her mind. Should she become
hopelessly insane, he would be almost as safe as if
she were dead, the doctor thought, and he always waited
with fierce impatience for news from Austria, when he
knew that it was due. Von Schoisner’s last letter had
reported her as very weak, with growing symptoms of
imbecility, and though the villainous man did feel a
pang of remorse when he remembered the sunny-faced
girl who had so loved and trusted him, he knew he had
gone too far to think of retracing his steps. There was
nothing left but to go on, and as his life at the Forrest
House had not proved a success he had made up his
mind to sell it and go to Europe to live permanently as
soon as Josephine was better. He could hide himself
there from justice, should it attempt to overtake him,
and he waited anxiously for any signs of amendment in
his wife.</p>

<p class='c011'>She did seem better that stormy night, when even he
quailed a little and felt nervous as he listened to the
roaring wind, which, he fancied, had in it the sound of
human sobbing. She had slept for more than an hour,
and when she awoke she was quiet, and more rational
than she had been for days. But there was a look of
death about her mouth and nose, and her eyes were unnaturally
bright as they fixed themselves on Agnes, who
sat watching her.</p>

<p class='c011'>The doctor had taken advantage of her sleep to steal
away for a while, and in the dining-room was trying to
stifle his conscience with the fumes of tobacco and the
brandy, of which he drank largely and often. Thus
Agnes was left alone with her sister, whose first question,
asked in a whisper, was:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where is <em>he</em>,—the doctor, I mean?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Gone to rest,” was the reply, and Josephine continued:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, let him rest while he can. It will soon be over,
and then a dungeon for <em>him</em>, and darkness, and blankness,
and utter forgetfulness for me; Aggie, that’s all a
fable about a hereafter,—a rag of mythology which
recent science has torn in shreds. We do not go somewhere
when we die; we perish like the brutes.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>“Oh, no, no! God forbid!” and falling on her knees,
with her hands clasped together, Agnes murmured words
of prayer for the soul so deluded and deceived.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hush, Agnes,” Josephine said, almost fiercely.
“There’s more important work on hand just now than
praying for one who does not want your prayers, for
even if there be a hereafter, it’s now too late for me, and
I care no more for it than a stone. I cannot feel, and
it’s no use to try. If there is a hell, which I don’t believe,
I shall go there; if there is not, then I am all right,
and the sooner I am like the clods the better; but I must
do one good act. Agnes, do you think Everard would
come here to-night if he knew I was dying,—for I am;
I feel it, and I must tell him something, which will perhaps
make him think more kindly of me than he does
now. Can you manage it for me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, no,” Agnes exclaimed. “He would not come
here to-night of all others, because——”</p>

<p class='c011'>She checked herself suddenly, and then added:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Listen to the rain and the wind; did you ever hear
such a storm?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I hear,” Josephine replied, excitedly. “It
was sent for me, and I am going out on its wings, but it
seems dreary to go in such a way. Oh, Aggie, if there
should be a hereafter,—but there is not. We all do
sleep,—sleep. But Everard, Everard,—I must see him,
or maybe you would tell him when I am dead. Lock
the door, Aggie; then come close to me and swear,—swear
that you will tell him,—that Rossie——Oh,
Agnes, I am so afraid of him,—the doctor, that I dare
not say it!” and on the white face there was a look of
terror such as Agnes had never seen before.</p>

<p class='c011'>There could be no doubt in her mind as to what her
sister meant, and regardless of consequences, she bent
down and whispered:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know,—I understand. Rossie is not dead. She
is alive and coming home.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How do you know? Have you seen the letter?”
Josephine almost shrieked, and Agnes replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I found it under the carpet long ago, just after
I came here, but I did not suppose that you had ever
seen it.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>“I had; I did; I put it there,” Josephine said, gasping
out the story of her having taken it from the office,
and the hiding it afterward. “And you found it?
Where is it now?” she asked, and Agnes replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I gave it to Miss Belknap, and she——”</p>

<p class='c011'>Agnes did not finish, for Josephine started upright
in bed, exclaiming:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I see; I know. She went suddenly to Europe,—to
find Rossie; tell me the truth. Has she found her, and
is she coming home, and what will it be for him?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Agnes knew that by <em>him</em> Dr. Matthewson was meant,
and she replied unhesitatingly:</p>

<p class='c011'>“State prison for him and poverty for you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I know. Poverty, disgrace, State prison for
life, and how soon? Tell me how soon? He might
have time to fly, for I,—I,—he is not good, but I’d rather
he did not go to prison. He is my husband, you know.
How soon? Tell me truly.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“To-night,—now,—the train is due and overdue. I
do not believe he can get away. I think he is watched.
Lawyer Russell knows,—not Everard yet; and Mr. and
Mrs. Morton are coming to-night with Rossie,” Agnes
said, rapidly; and the next moment a wild shriek rang
through the house, which Dr. Matthewson heard above
the storm, and he came reeling up the stairs from his
brandy and cigars, but was sobered at once when he
found his wife in the most horrible fit he had ever witnessed.</p>

<p class='c011'>When it was over, and she became conscious again,
it was pitiable to see how hard she tried to speak and
warn him of his danger, but could not, for the power of
utterance was gone, and she only gave forth inarticulate
sounds which he could not comprehend any more than
he could understand what had affected her so strangely.
It was in vain that he appealed to Agnes, who was whiter
if possible than her sister, and trembling from head to
foot. She was sworn to secrecy,—and if she had inadvertently
said to Josephine things which she ought not,
she must keep silence before the doctor, and bear the
glance of the eyes which looked so imploringly at her,
and seemed about to leap from their sockets when she
shook her head in token that she could not tell. There
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>were flecks of blood and foam about the pallid lips, and
drops of sweat upon the face and hands, the latter of
which beat the air hopelessly as the dying woman tried
to speak. At last, when they had no more power to
move, they dropped helplessly upon the bed, and the
white, haggard face grew whiter and more haggard as she
lay with ears strained to catch the sound for which she
listened so intently, and which came at last in a shrill,
prolonged whistle, which was distinctly heard in the
pauses of the abating storm, as the train so long delayed
swept through the town. Then, summoning all her remaining
strength for one last great effort, Josephine
raised her arm in the air, and motioning to the door,
said to her husband in a voice which was to sound in his
ears through many years to come:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Doomed,—doomed,—fl——”</p>

<p class='c011'>She could not finish and say “fly,” as she wished to
do, for the word died away in a low, gurgling moan;
the white foam poured again from lips and nose, and
when the convulsions ceased and the distorted features
resumed their natural look, the soul had gone to meet its
God.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER LII.<br> <span class='large'>BREAKING THE NEWS TO EVERARD.</span></h2>

<div class='c010'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/di_377.jpg' width='100' alt=''>
</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
It was an hour behind the usual time when the
train from the north stopped for a moment
at Rothsay, and four people, or rather three,
stepped out into the storm, and hurried to
the shelter of the carriage waiting for them.
The fourth, whose face was carefully hidden from sight,
was carried in the strong arms of Yulah, and held like
a child until Beatrice’s house was reached, where it was
taken at once to the room which Rossie used to occupy,
when visiting at Elm Park. Rossie was very tired and
very weak, both in body and mind, but had not seemed
at all excited during the journey from New York until
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>Rothsay was reached, and she was in the carriage riding
along the old familiar road she had once thought she
should never see again. Then she roused from her
apathy, and sitting upright looked eagerly out through
the driving rain toward the Forrest House, which lay to
their right, and seemed to blaze with lights, as the startled
servants moved rapidly from room to room,—for it was
just then that the soul had taken wing and was on its
flight to the world untried.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Look, look!” she said, “so many lights in the old
home, as if to welcome me back. Is Everard there waiting
for me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, Rossie,” Beatrice said. “We are not going
there to-night. I thought it best to bring you home
with me until you have seen Everard.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a little sigh of disappointment, and then
Rossie laid her head on Yulah’s arm, and did not speak
again until she was on the soft bed in the blue room at
Elm Park, where, when Bee asked her how she felt, she
whispered: “So happy and glad, because I shall see
him in the morning; send for him very early.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And when the morning came a message was dispatched
to Everard to the effect that Mr. and Mrs.
Morton had returned and wished to see him immediately.
But another message had found its way to the office
before this one, for knots of crape were streaming in the
November wind from every door-knob at the Forrest
House, and the village bell was tolling in token that
some soul had gone to the God who gave it.</p>

<p class='c011'>In his office Everard sat listening to the bell, every
stroke of which thrilled him with a sensation of something
like dread, as if that knell of death were in some
way connected with himself. Who was it dead that day
that the bell should clamor so long, and would it never
strike the age, he asked himself, just as the door opened
and Lawyer Russell came in, flurried and excited, and
red and white by turns as he shook the rain-drops from
his overcoat, for the storm, though greatly abated, was
not over yet.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who is dead? Do you know?” Everard asked, and
Mr. Russell replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, Ned; it will be a great shock to you,—an infernal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>shock,—though of course you were all over any
hankering after her; but it’s that Matthewson woman.
She died last night, and there’s about forty yards of crape
flying from the doors up there, and the doctor, they say, is
actually taking on to kill, and blubbering like a calf;
but we’ll fix him. You’ll see; he’s watched; there’s a
po——oh, Lord! what have I said, or come near
saying?”</p>

<p class='c011'>And in his disgust at himself for having nearly let
out the secret before the time, the lawyer retreated into
the adjoining room, leaving Everard alone to meet what
<em>had</em> been a terrible shock to him, for though he had
heard at different times from Agnes of Josephine’s illness,
he had never believed her dangerous; and now she
was dead; the woman he once fancied that he loved.
There were great drops of sweat about his mouth and
under his hair, and his lips quivered nervously while,
human as he was, there came over him with a rush the
thought that now indeed he was free in a way which even
Rossie would have recognized had she been alive. But
Rossie, too, was dead; his freedom had come too late.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Everybody is dead,” he whispered, sadly, while
hot tears sprang to his eyes and rolled down his cheeks,—tears,
not for the woman at the Forrest House, for whom
the bell kept steadily tolling, but for the dear little girl
dead, as he believed, so far away, but who, in reality,
was so very near, and even then asking when he would
come.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Soon, darling, soon,” Beatrice said, for she had sent
a note to Everard, and the messenger was at his office
door and in the room before Everard was aware of his
presence.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mrs. Morton at home!” he exclaimed, as he took
the note from the servant’s hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Everard</span>,” Beatrice wrote, “we came home
last night on the late train, and I am so anxious to see
you, and have so much to tell. Don’t delay a minute,
but come at once.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Yours,      <span class='sc'>Bee</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>She had something to tell him of Rossie, of course, and
in an instant he was in the street, speeding along toward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>Elm Park, and glancing but once in the direction of the
Forrest House, where every blind was closed, and where,
through the leafless trees, he could see the flapping of the
yards of crape which Lawyer Russell had said were
streaming from the doors. For an instant a cold shudder
went over him as if he had seen a corpse, but that
soon passed away, and when Elm Park was reached he
was in such a fever of excitement that the sweat-drops
stood like rain upon his face, which, nevertheless, was
very pale, as he greeted Beatrice, and asked:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Did you hear anything of her? Did you find her
grave, or see any one who was with her at the last?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Beatrice had planned everything thus far with great
coolness and nerve. She had kept Rossie quiet, and
made her very sweet and attractive in one of her own
dainty, white wrappers, and arranged her beautiful hair,
which had been kept short at the <i><span lang="fr">Maison de Sante</span></i>, but
which was now growing in soft, curling rings, giving to
her small, white face a singularly young expression, so
that she might easily have passed for a child of fourteen
as she reclined upon the pillows, a smile upon her lips,
and an eager, expectant look in her large, bright eyes,
turning constantly to the door at every sound which met
her ear. At last she heard the well-remembered voice in
the hall below and the step upon the stairs, for Bee had
after all lost her self-control, and in answer to Everard’s
rapid questions, had said: “We did hear news of Rossie,
and, oh, Everard, don’t let anything astonish or startle
you, but go up stairs to the blue room, Rossie’s old room,
you know.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He did not wait to hear more, but darted up the stairs,
expecting, not to find his darling there alive, but dead,
perhaps, and thus brought back to him, for Bee was
capable of anything; so he sped on his way, and entered
the room where the fire burned so brightly in the grate,
and flowers were everywhere, while through the window
came a sudden gleam of sunlight, which fell directly on
the couch where lay, not a dead, but a living Rossie,
with a halo of gladness on her face, and in her beautiful
eyes, which met him as he came so swiftly into the room,
pausing suddenly with a cry, half of terror, half of joy,
as he saw the little girl among the pillows raise herself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>upright and stretch her arms towards him, while she
called so clearly and sweetly: “Oh, Everard, I am home
again, and you <em>may</em> kiss me once.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a sudden movement of his hand to his
head as if the blow had struck him there, and then he
staggered rather than walked toward the white-robed
figure, which sprang into his arms and nestled there
like a frightened bird which has been torn from its nest
and suddenly finds itself safe in its shelter again. For
an instant Everard recoiled from the embrace as if it
were a phantom he held, but only for an instant, for
there was nothing phantom-like in the warm flesh and
blood trembling in his arms; nothing corpse-like in the
soft hands caressing his face, or in the eyes meeting his
so fondly. It was Rossie herself come back to him from
the grave where he had thought her buried, and the shock
was at first so overpowering that he could not utter a
word; he could only look at her with wildly staring eyes,
and face which quivered all over with strong emotions,
while his heart beat so loudly that every throb was audible
to himself and Rossie, who, as he did not speak,
lifted her head from his shoulder and said, “What is it,
Everard? Are you not glad to have me home again?”</p>

<p class='c011'>That broke the spell, and brought a shower of kisses
upon her face and lips, while he murmured words of
fondness and love, and poured forth question after question,
until Rossie grew bewildered and confused, and
whispered faintly: “I don’t know; I don’t understand;
I am very tired; ask Beatrice, she knows; she did it; let
me lie down again.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He saw how pale and weary she looked, and placed
her among the pillows, but held her hands in his, while
he turned to Beatrice, who had been standing just outside
the door, and who now came forward.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not here; Rossie is too tired. She cannot bear it,”
she said, as he asked her what it meant, and where she
had found his darling.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, drawing him into the adjoining room, she told
him very rapidly all the steps which had led to Rossie’s
release from the mad-house, which had been intended
as her living tomb. And as he listened to the story,
Everard grew more and more enraged, until he seemed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>like some wild animal roused to the highest pitch of
fury; and seizing his hat, was about rushing from the
room, when Beatrice detained him; and, locking the
door to prevent his egress, said to him: “I know what
is in your mind. You wish to arrest the doctor at once,
but there is no haste at present. Everything has been
attended to for you. Ever since Lawyer Russell heard
from me that Rossie was alive, the Forrest House has
been under close espionage, and escape for the doctor
made impossible. Last night, in all that storm, officers
were on guard, so that he could not get away if he had
received a hint of what has been done.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I know; but now,—now,—why not seize him
now? Why wait any longer, when I long to tear him
limb from limb?” Everard exclaimed, gnashing his teeth
in his rage, and seeming to Beatrice like a tiger doing
battle for its young.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Because,” she answered, and she spoke softly now,
“we must hold his sorrow sacred. We must let him bury
his dead. Surely you know that Josephine died last
night?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, yes, but I’d forgotten it in my excitement,” he
gasped, and his face was whiter, if possible, than before.
“You are right; we must not molest him now, but have
a double watch,—yes, treble, if necessary. He must not
escape.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was terrible vengeance in Everard’s flashing
eyes as he paced up and down the room. Dr. Matthewson,
though he were ten times Rossie’s brother, had
nothing to hope from him; but for the sake of the dead
woman lying in such state at the Forrest House, he must
keep quiet and bide his time. So, after another interview
with Rossie, whose weak state he began to understand
more plainly, he left her, and schooled himself to
go quietly back to his office and transact his business as
if he were not treading the borders of a mine which
would explode when he bade it do so. At his request,
the number of officers was doubled, and every possible
precaution taken lest the victim should escape, which he
did not seem likely to do, for he made a great show of
his grief, and sat all day by the side of his dead wife,
seeing no one but Agnes and those who had the funeral
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>in charge. Thus, he did not even know of Beatrice’s
sudden return, which took the people so by surprise, and
was the theme of wonder and comment second only to
the grand funeral for which such great preparations were
making, and which was to take place the third day after
the death.</p>

At Elm Park the utmost secrecy was maintained
with regard to Rossie, whose presence in the
house was wholly unsuspected by any one
except the few necessarily in the secret. The
servants knew, of course, but they were
trusty and silent as the grave, and almost as eager for
the denouement as Yulah, herself, who had personal
wrongs to be avenged, but who seldom spoke to any one
lest she should betray what must be kept. Two or three
times, after dark, she had stolen up to the Forrest House,
which she examined minutely, while she shook her fist
and muttered in execration of the man who, she heard,
sat constantly by his wife, with his face buried in his
hands, as if he really mourned for the woman whom he
knew so much better than any one else. And to a certain
extent his grief was genuine. Her beauty had dazzled
and pleased him, and something in her selfish,
treacherous nature had so answered to his own, that in
a way she was necessary to him, and when she went
from him so suddenly, he experienced a shock and sense
of loss which struck him down as he had never before
been stricken.</p>

<p class='c011'>Agnes wished to have her sister taken to Holburton
and buried by her mother. But Holburton was too democratic
a town, and Roxie Fleming’s bones far too plebeian
for his wife to lie beside, and so he bought a vacant
lot in Rothsay, and gave orders that no expense should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>be spared to make the funeral worthy of his money and
position as the richest man in the county.</p>

<p class='c011'>And now, at the close of the third day, the grand
funeral was over,—and grand it certainly was, if a costly
coffin, a profusion of flowers, twenty carriages, and a
multitude of lookers-on, could make it so; but how much
real grief there was, aside from what Agnes felt, was a
matter of speculation to the people, who went in crowds
to the Forrest House, which was filled from kitchen to
parlor. And the doctor knew they were there, and felt
a thrill of gratification at the honor paid him, though
he sat with his head bent down, and never once looked
up or seemed to notice any one. Even had he glanced
about him at the sea of heads filling anterooms and
halls, he would not have remarked the men, who, without
any apparent intention, were always in the foreground,
just where they could command a view of the
chief mourner in the imposing procession which moved
slowly to the cemetery, where all that was mortal of
Josephine was buried from sight. At the grave the
doctor’s grief took a demonstrative form, and he stood
with his face covered with his hands, while his body
shook as if from suppressed sobs, and when a low cry
escaped Agnes as the coffin box scraped the gravelly
earth, he put out his arm toward her as if to comfort and
reassure her; but she instinctively drew back, with a
feeling of treachery in her heart, as if for the sake of the
dead sister she ought to warn him of his danger, and give
him a chance to escape, if it were possible, which she
doubted; for, though she did not know just what the plan
was, she knew how closely the house had been watched,
and recognized in the crowd the men whom she had seen
on the premises, and whose office she rightly conjectured.
But she had sworn to keep the secret, and so her lips
were sealed, and she never uttered a word as they drove
back to the house, where she went directly to her room,
and on her knees begged forgiveness if she were doing a
wrong to the unsuspecting man, who, all unconscious of
peril, went also to his own room to draw what consolation
he could from the fumes of his best cigars and the
poison of his brandies.</p>

<p class='c011'>And so he was as surely doomed as if the manacles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>were already upon his hands, and the prison walls around
him. In the hall below there was the sound of voices in
low consultation, Everard’s voice, and Lawyer Russell’s,
and the officers of justice, who had taken possession of
the house and locked every door below to shut off all
means of escape. In the kitchen the astonished and
frightened servants were crowded together, asking each
other what it meant and what was about to happen, but
not one of them dared to move after the officers commanded
that they keep quiet, whatever might occur.
Then, up the stairs came the two strange men, with
Everard and Mr. Russell following close behind, and on
through the hall to the door of the doctor’s room. It
was a little ajar, and he heard their footsteps, and half
rose to meet them as they stepped across the threshold.
But when he saw Everard’s white, set face, and saw how
excited Lawyer Russell seemed, there flashed over him an
inkling of the truth, and when the foremost of the officers
advanced toward him, and laying his hand on his
arm, arrested him for perjury, he felt sure that the desperate
game he had been playing had ended in disgrace
and defeat. But he was too proud to manifest any
emotion whatever. If his revolver had been in his pocket,
where he usually carried it, he would have used it
unhesitatingly, but it was not. He had no means of defense,
and in as natural a tone of voice as he could
command, he asked what they meant, and on what ground
the arrest was made; how had he perjured himself, and
when?</p>

<p class='c011'>“When you swore that Rossie was dead, and knew
that it was false, and that she was incarcerated in a mad-house
where you put her, you villain! Rossie is not
dead; she is here in town,—at Elm Park, and all your
infernal rascality is known,” Everard burst out, for he
could restrain himself no longer, and he felt a thrill of
triumph when he saw how white the doctor grew, and
how for a moment he tottered as if he would fall.</p>

<p class='c011'>He did not attempt to get away; he merely said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Rossie here? Rossie alive? Take me to her. I
must see her. Gentlemen, there is some mistake, which
can be cleared up if only I can see her. I beg of you,
take me to her.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>But his request was not granted. He was a prisoner,
and all resistance was vain. Cold and pallid, and seemingly
indifferent, he did just what they bade him do, and
went with them down the stairs and out of the house he
was never to enter again. On the piazza outside they
encountered a strange woman, who threw herself directly
in the prisoner’s way, and shrieked into his ear:</p>

<p class='c011'>“It bees you, Dr. Matthewson. I knows you, sure,
and I has the revenge. I finds her there in Haelder-Strauchsen,
and sends the letter here to <em>him</em>, (pointing to
Everard), and the lady, Madame Morton. She comes
and I gets her away, and you into the <i><span lang="fr">conciergerie</span></i>,—ha,
ha! What does you think now of the tragic queen?”
and she snapped her fingers in his face, which was deadly
white, and livid in spots as he recoiled from her, exclaiming:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yulah! betrayed by you!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, me. I swore it. I’s glad to be revenge,”
she cried, and was going on with more abuse when the
officer stopped her, and hurried the doctor away to a
place of safety, where a close guard was placed over
him, and he was left alone with his wretched thoughts.</p>

<p class='c011'>It did not take long for the news to spread over the
town, for secrecy was no longer necessary, and never had
there been such wild excitement in Rothsay. That Rossie
Hastings had been alive all this time, and buried in
a mad-house, while her brother enjoyed her property,
seemed almost incredible, but there could be no doubt
of it, for old Axie had seen her, and talked with her face
to face, and in their fury a mob, preceded by the old
negress, assembled in the streets, and surrounding the
building where the doctor was confined, demanded the
prisoner, that they might wreak vengeance on him then
and there.</p>

<p class='c011'>Order was, however, soon restored, and the wretched
man was left in quiet to think over his wicked past, and
to dread the future, which he knew had no hope for him.
His sin had found him out, and though he had not conscience
enough to be much troubled with remorse, his
pride and self-love were cruelly wounded, and he writhed
in the anguish of bitter mortification and rage.</p>

<div class='c010'>
  <img class='drop-capi' src='images/di_387.jpg' width='100' alt=''>
</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
Rossie had asked, on her voyage home, who
lived at the Forrest House, and had been
simply told that Josephine was there still,
but no mention had been made of the unnatural
marriage lest it should excite her too
much. Now, however, it was desirable that she should
know the truth, in part, at least, for her testimony would
be necessary when the trial came on. So Everard told it
to her a few days after the arrest, when she seemed
stronger than usual, and able to bear it.</p>

<p class='c011'>She had been steadily improving since Rothsay was
reached, though she talked but little, and was most of
the time so absorbed in thought that she did not always
hear when spoken to, or answer if she did. She heard,
however, when Everard came, and recognized his step
the moment he touched the piazza, and her pale face
would light up with sudden joy and her large eyes glow
like coals of fire; but since their first interview she had
not suffered him to kiss her, or even to hold her hands in
his as he sat and talked to her. Josephine living was
a bar between them still, and Everard guessed as much,
and told her at last that Josephine had died on the very
night of her return to Rothsay. She was sitting in her
easy-chair, with her head resting upon a pillow, and her
little white, thin hands held tightly on her lap, as if
afraid of the masculine fingers beating restlessly upon
the arm of her chair. But when she heard of Josephine’s
death, her hands involuntarily unlocked and crept toward
the restless fingers, which caught and held them fast
while Everard went on very slowly and cautiously to tell
her the rest of the story,—the part which involved her
brother, whose name he had not before mentioned to
her. At first she listened breathlessly, with parted lips
and wide-open eyes, which almost frightened him with
their expression of wonder, and surprise, and incredulity.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>“Everard,—Everard!” she gasped, “you are not
telling me the truth? Say you are not. I would almost
rather have died in that dreadful place than know my
brother did this. Surely it is not true?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, true in every particular,” Everard replied,
softening now as much as possible what he had still to
tell of the man whose trial would come on very soon,
and for whom there was no escape.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Couldn’t you save him, Everard, if you should try?
Couldn’t I do something?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, Rossie,” he answered. “You could not save
him, and ought not if you could. Men like him must be
punished,—must answer for their misdeeds, else there is
no such thing as justice or protection for any one. You
are not angry with me, Rossie?” he continued, as she
drew her hand from his and leaned back in her chair.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, not angry; only it is all so very horrible, and
brings the buzzing back, and the confusion, and I hardly
know who I am, or who you are, or what it’s all about,
only you must go away. I can’t hear any more,” she
said, wearily; and after that there were days and weeks
when she lay in bed, and scarcely moved or noticed any
one, except Everard, whom she welcomed with her sweetest
smile, saying to him always the same thing:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have been thinking and thinking, and praying and
praying, and I suppose it is right, but oh! I am so
sorry.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Everard knew that her mind was dwelling upon the
miserable man, who, when told of her condition and that
the trial was to be delayed till she was able to give her
testimony, had said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“No need of that. I don’t want Rossie dragged
into the court to swear against me. I know more than
she does; nothing can save me. I shall not put in a
defense;” and he did not.</p>

<p class='c011'>Coldly, proudly, and apparently unmoved, he sat in
the criminal’s seat and listened to his trial, and saw the
looks of horror and execration cast at him, and saw
Yulah’s face, like the face of a fiend, sneering exultingly
at him, and heard at last his sentence of imprisonment
with the utmost composure; and no one who saw him on
his way to his new home would have dreamed of the fate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>which awaited him. Only once did he show what he felt,
and that was when the prison dress was brought for him
to put on. He had been very fastidious with regard to
his personal appearance, and he flinched a little and
turned pale for an instant, then rallying quickly he tried
to smile and affect some pleasantry with regard to the
unsightly garb which transformed him at once from an
elegant man of fashion into a branded felon, with no
mark of distinction between him and his daily companions.</p>

</div><p class='drop-capi_8'>
After the trial was over, and the doctor safely
lodged in prison to serve out his length of
time, Rothsay gradually grew quiet and
ceased to talk of the startling events which
had thrown the town into such commotion.
They were getting accustomed to the fact that
Rossie was alive and with them again. She had appeared
in the streets with Beatrice two or three times,
and many of her old friends had been admitted to see
her, but she was still very weak in body and mind, and
was kept as quiet as possible. Beatrice had made a short
visit with her husband to Boston, but had returned
again to her own home, bringing Trix and Bunchie with
her, hoping the effect on Rossie might be good. And it
was, for from the moment the children came and turned
the orderly house upside down with their play and prattle,
she began to improve and seem much like the Rossie
of old, except that her face and figure were thinner and
there were no roses on her cheeks, and there was always
a tired look in her eyes and about her mouth. Of her
brother she never spoke, nor of Josephine either; neither
had she ever been near the Forrest House, which, without
her knowledge, had gradually been undergoing a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>transformation, preparatory to the time when she should
be equal to visit it. Both Everard and Beatrice, with
Aunt Axie to assist them, had been busy as bees, removing
from the house every article of furniture which
either the doctor or Josephine had bought, and replacing
it with the old, familiar things of Rossie’s childhood.</p>

<p class='c011'>When the doctor refurnished the house he had
ordered all the rubbish, as he called it, to be stored
away in the attics and unused rooms, where it had lain
untouched save as dust and cobwebs had accumulated
on it, and thus it was comparatively easy for the rooms
to assume their natural appearance, except so far as they
had been changed by new windows and doors, and partitions
thrown down to make them more commodious.
Could Axie have had her way, she would have put everything
back as it was, and not have left a vestige of the
past, but Everard had the good sense to see that the
changes were such as both he and Rossie would like
when accustomed to them. He put himself with Rossie,
for he knew he should live there with her, although
nothing definite was settled by word of mouth. He had
a plan which he meant to carry out, and when the house
was restored to itself, and the same old carpets were on
the floor, and the same old pictures on the wall, and the
chairs in his father’s room standing just as they stood
that day when Rossie came to him so fearlessly and
asked to be his wife, he went to her and said she was to
ride with him that morning, as there was something he
wished to show her. She assented readily, and was soon
beside him in Beatrice’s phaeton, driving toward the
Forrest House grounds, into which he suddenly turned.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Everard,” she cried, as her cheek flushed scarlet,
“where are you going? Not there? I cannot bear it
yet. It will bring the buzzing back, and all the uncertainty.
Don’t go, please. It’s like a haunted place.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But Everard was firm, and quieted her as well as he
could, and pointed out Aunt Axie standing in the door
just as she used to stand waiting for her young mistress,
and John farther on in the stable-yard, and even the old
dogs barking in the early sunshine, and running to meet
them as they came up. It did not seem strange nor
haunted now, and Rossie made no resistance when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>Everard lifted her from the phaeton and carried her into
the house, which seemed so restful and home-like that
she felt all her old morbid feelings and fears dropping
from her, and flitted from room to room like some joyous
bird, until she came to the judge’s chamber, where
she paused a moment on the threshold, while there flashed
upon her a remembrance of that day which seemed so
long ago, when she had entertained it so fearlessly, and
done that for which she always blushed when she recalled
it. Passing his arm around her Everard drew her
into the room, and closing the door made her sit down
beside him, while he said, “Rossie, you surely have not
forgotten a scene which took place here more than six
years ago, when a miserable, sorely-tried young man sat
here a beggar, with a secret on his mind far worse and
harder to bear than prospective poverty. And while he
sat thinking of the future, and shrinking from it with a
dread of which you cannot conceive, there came to him a
little sweet-faced girl, who, in her desire to comfort him
and give back what she believed to be his, asked to
be his wife, without a thought of shame. No, Rossie,
don’t try to get away from me, for you cannot. I shall
keep you now, forever,” he continued, as Rossie tried to
free herself from the arm which only held her closer,
as Everard went on: “In one sense that time seems to
me ages and ages ago, so much has happened since,
while in another it seems but yesterday, so distinctly do I
recall every incident and detail, even to the dress and
apron you wore, and the expression of your face as it
changed from perfect unconsciousness to a sense of what
you had done. You came to me a child, but you left me
a woman, whom I do believe I would even then have
taken to my heart but for the bar between us. That bar
is now removed, and Rossie, my darling, I have brought
you here to the old home, and into the very room, to
answer the question you asked me then, that is, if you
are still of the same mind. Are you, Rossie? Do you
still wish to be my wife?”</p>

<p class='c011'>He had her face between his two hands, and was
looking into her eyes, which filled with tears as she said
to him: “Oh, Everard, yes, yes. I have wished it so
much when it was wicked to do so, and now that it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>not, I wish it still; only I am afraid I must not, for there
is such a horrible fear before me all the time which I cannot
shake off. Day and night it haunts me, that I am
not all right in my brain. I saw so much and suffered
so much that I can’t put things together quite straight,
and my head buzzes at times, and I do not remember,
and am even troubled to know just who I am and what
has happened. Oh, do you think, do you suppose I am
going to be a,——a,——” She hesitated, and her lips
quivered pitifully as she finally pronounced the dreadful
word,—“fool.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Everard’s laugh was something pleasant and good to
hear, it was so long and loud.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Fool, Rossie. No. You are only tired out and
must have the perfect rest which you can find alone with
me,” he said, and he covered her face with kisses. “And
were you ten times a fool, I want you just the same.
And you are mine, my own precious little Rossie who
will be my wife very soon. There is no need for delay,
I want you and you need me, and Beatrice ought to go
to her husband, which she will not do while she thinks
you need her care. So it will be within two weeks at
the farthest. You need no preparation, just to come
home,—though we will go away farther South for a
while, where the season is earlier and where the roses will
soon come back to these pale cheeks and vigor to the
poor, tired brain.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Rossie let him arrange it all as he pleased, and the
wedding took place two weeks from that day in Beatrice’s
drawing-room, without parade or show, for both
bride and groom had suffered too much to care for
publicity now; but both were perfectly happy, and
Rossie’s face was sweet and beautiful as are the faces of
Murillo’s Madonnas, as she lifted it for her husband’s first
kiss, and heard him say, “My wife at last, thank God.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a trip southward as far as the mountains
of Tennessee, where, in a lovely, secluded spot Rossie
gained so rapidly both in body and mind, that the second
week in May was fixed upon for their return to the Forrest
House, where Aunt Axie again reigned supreme, and
where Agnes had found a haven of rest at last. Beatrice,
who had gone with Trix and Bunchie to Boston,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>had offered Agnes a home with her as nursery governess
to the children, but Rossie had said to her first, “If you
can, Aggie, I wish you would live with me. It will make
me happier to have you at the Forrest House,” and so
Agnes went to the Forrest House, and was there to meet
the newly-married couple, when they came back one
lovely afternoon in May to take possession of their old
house, amid the pealing of bells and the rejoicings of the
people, who had assembled in crowds upon the lawn in
front of the house, where Everard’s most intimate acquaintances
had arranged a grand picnic, to which all
who were his friends and wished to do him honor were
publicly invited. It would seem as if everybody was his
friend or Rossie’s, for the whole town was out, filling
the grounds, which were beautifully decorated, while
over the gateway a lovely arch of flowers was erected
with the inscription on it, “Welcome to the rightful
heirs.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And so, amid the ringing of bells and the huzzas of
the crowd, and strains of sweet music as the Rothsay
band played a merry strain, Everard and Rossie drove
up the avenue and passed into the house where they had
known so much joy and sorrow both, and which hereafter
was to be to them an abode of perfect peace and
happiness.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a dance upon the lawn that night, after
the hundreds of lamps and lanterns were lighted, and
people came from afar to see the sight, which equaled
the outdoor fetes of the <i><span lang="fr">Champs d’Elyesees</span></i>, and were continued
until the village clock chimed twelve, when, with
hearty handshakes and three cheers for Mr. and Mrs.
Forrest, the crowd departed to their respective homes,
and peace and quiet reigned again at the Forrest House.</p>

<p class='c011'>And now, there is little more to tell of the characters
with whom my readers have grown familiar.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dr. Morton is still in Boston, and perfectly happy
with Beatrice, who is the best of wives and step-mothers,
idolized by husband and little ones, and greatly honored
by the people, notwithstanding that she sometimes
startles them with her independent way of acting and
thinking.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yulah is at the Forrest House in the capacity of waiting-maid,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>and no one looking at her usually placid German
face would dream of the terrible expression it can
assume if but the slightest allusion is made to the
wretched man who in his felon’s cell drags out his miserable
days, with no hope of the future, and nothing but
horror and remorse in his retrospect of the past. Once
or twice he has written to Rossie, asking her forgiveness,
and begging her to use her influence to shorten his term
of imprisonment. But Rossie is powerless there, and
can only weep over her fallen brother, whose punishment
she knows is just, and who is but reaping what he sowed
so bountifully.</p>

<p class='c011'>In course of time Everard heard from Michel Fahen
of the excitement caused by Rossie’s escape, of the
means taken at first to trace her, and of the indignation
of the people, and the invectives heaped upon Van
Schoisner when Michel told, as he was finally compelled
to do, what he knew of Rossie’s unjust detention as a
lunatic. It is more than six months now since Rossie
came home a bride, and in that time no cloud, however
small, has darkened her domestic horizon or brought a
shadow to her face. The house has been refurnished
from garret to cellar, and is seldom without guests, both
from city and country, while the village people are never
tired of taking their friends to see the beautiful grounds,
of which they are so proud, and to call upon the fair young
matron, on whom the duties of wifehood sit so prettily,
and who is as sweet and innocent as in the days when
she wore her white sun-bonnet, and was known as Little
Rossie Hastings.</p>

    <div class='c003'><span class='large'>CARLETON’S</span></div>
    <div><span class='xlarge'>HOUSEHOLD ENCYCLOPÆDIA</span></div>
    <div><span class='small'>AND</span></div>
    <div>HAND-BOOK OF GENERAL INFORMATION.</div>
    <div class='c002'><em>A Large, Handsome Volume of 500 Pages, Clear Type, Beautifully Printed, and PROFUSELY ILLUSTRATED.</em></div>
    <div class='c002'><em>Elegantly Bound in Cloth, Presentation Style.</em></div>
    <div class='c002'>EDITED BY THE ABLEST TALENT THE WORLD AFFORDS.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>This is one of the most wonderful books ever published. It is a handy book of
reference upon nearly every subject that can possibly be thought of. It contains, in
a single volume, what can otherwise be learned only from a great many different
works—large and costly encyclopædias, dictionaries, etc.; and, instead of long
and diffuse chapters of information, it gives what nearly every one wants to know in
a very few lines—in a nut-shell, so to speak. No <em>single volume</em> was ever before published
that can compare to it.</p>

<p class='c011'>In reading nearly any book or paper, there are frequent references to a thousand
and one matters which the general reader would like to understand a little more
about, and which, unless he has a large library of costly books to refer to, he can
learn nothing; but here, with this one volume, <cite>CARLETON’S HOUSEHOLD
ENCYCLOPÆDIA</cite>, he can turn at once to the <span class='sc'>Index</span> and find the page, and the
whole thing is clearly and concisely explained! There has never been any <em>one book</em>
so immensely valuable for the General Public.</p>

<p class='c011'>A very important feature of the book is, that, in addition to every subject being
carefully indexed by <em>itself</em>, so that any one word can be turned to at once, the reader will
find everything relating to one general subject is collected together under one general
classification. For example:—Mythology is treated of in one place, and everything
about it is under one chapter, while, in the <span class='sc'>Complete Index</span>, each individual character
and reference is alphabetically found, thus enabling the reader to study the
whole of <span class='sc'>Mythology</span>, or to refer at a glance to any one mythological character, and
learn all about it in one short paragraph. The same in History, Science, Philosophy,
Geography, Art, etc., etc.</p>

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
